Okay, depends because we have something pending to Saturday, we can do it Saturday, but normally, you know, normally the drivers Monday to Friday. But, ah, okay. It depends. It depends how much urgency or oh, we have a like a special request for this Saturday or Sunday or whatever. Ah, okay, okay. So, if there's a special request, then you can do the work. It's more like a special request, right? But there's no problem for me. Ah, okay, okay. Uh, you are the owner as well, right? Of the mobile mechanic service? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, uh, Louis, just to be clear, we are not looking for work. We help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service. Okay?

Hey, my time My My time and my and my driving time is close, right? So what what I do is like personally, I do I charge you like a 150 or 120 bucks with the inspection, right? If with the customer, the customer decides to fix the car by me, right? I can I can I can leave the charge or the the the cost on the inspection, right? And and I charge it like it's supposed to be like whatever whatever service. Because, you know, some people some people call you to, oh, can I you inspect my car, you do for free, right? And you give you the diagnostic, give you the solution and then the person go to the somebody else and fix the car. So you you fix the problem but somebody else, no, no, no, no, no. Correct. Yes, yes, yes. It makes not make sense, Louis. And also, this is like the best number that customers can contact you or you have alternative number? So, they can call me same number. This is the best one. Okay. Yeah, so right now right now I'm the way on the customer because I have to go to have a uh reprogram to car computer 2 and service.

I mean, I believe. Okay. You only like uh you do mobile, right? You go uh on the surrounding areas, like 21 20 miles radius in your area or you go further? Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. Right now, so right now we will like a 20 35 miles away from the customer. Oh, 30 35 miles away.
