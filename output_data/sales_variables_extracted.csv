Speaker A (00:09 - 00:27): How are you doing? Good, thanks for asking, sir. Appreciate you. But I was going to ask you to call. I was going to ask you to call you, sir. I'm looking for example business and area that does want to take on more new customers, Derek. And that's because we see our searching people online searching for modeling services. We wanted to see if this can be a good match for your business. Yep.
Speaker B (00:27 - 00:28): Tell me what you got.
Speaker A (00:28 - 00:32): Hey Duke, what kind of work do you guys usually take on at the moment or specializing at the most?
Speaker B (00:32 - 00:42): It's primarily home remodeling and repairs. So we do a little bit of everything. You can see roofing, bathrooms, kitchen floor refinishing, painting, patching, door installation.
Speaker A (00:43 - 00:51): Oh, nice. Nice. Okay, you guys check wall streets, right? Doing all the residential work. You guys do commercial as well? A lot of commercial work at the moment.
Speaker B (00:51 - 00:54): Got it. It's primarily residential, but we're not opposed to doing commercial.
Speaker A (00:54 - 01:01): Nice. All right, you guys only covering in Washington or do you guys travel out of state sometimes or just stay local?
Speaker B (01:02 - 01:06): We tried to stay local, but we'll go to the surrounding counties. So like the DMV area.
Speaker A (01:06 - 01:17): DMV area. Oh, nice. That's good coverage, sir. Okay, you guys only get people that call you through referrals or subcontracts with bigger companies or you guys have like marketing or like a sales team that helps you get customers as well.
Speaker B (01:18 - 01:21): We just started our doing more stuff online. Up to now it's been word of mouth.
Speaker A (01:22 - 01:29): All right, nice, sir. Okay, you have been looking to do like a website, doing ads like a meta Facebook or buying leads.
Speaker B (01:30 - 01:41): Eventually, mentally, right now we're. Yeah, let's just off the bridge if we want to grow. Right. Right now we're just one crew. If I choose to take on more crew than we would probably advertise.
Speaker A (01:41 - 02:10): Definitely, definitely, definitely guide you with that, sir. Look, it's very understandable. It's common user. We have a department that specializes on watching the Chapter 20 any type of industry during Washington, sir. There's 3,397 searches on the past 30 days for remodeling services online. Right. So basically what I wanted to do in your business, Derek, is offer you to build your online presence so he can make you visible in front of these instant customers online so they could potentially call you more directly. Alright. Is that something you've been interested in right now?
Speaker B (02:10 - 02:13): Not a good time. No. Yeah, not a good Time, you did.
Speaker A (02:13 - 02:17): Mention you guys are booked up with a lot of work, right? Are you guys, like, booked up for like, next six months?
Speaker B (02:17 - 02:21): No, we're not, but I'm just not ready to invest in marketing at this point.
Speaker A (02:21 - 02:30): I give you the option, right? Give you information. That way, once you're ready for this, you can give us a call or even consider us, at least. I'll give you a quick rundown, like two minutes. Sounds good.
Speaker B (02:30 - 02:31): Sure. Yep.
Speaker A (02:31 - 02:38): Now, while I was mentioning visibility, what do I mean by that? I don't know if you heard of a company called DC Ready Remodeling.
Speaker B (02:38 - 02:39): No, I haven't.
Speaker A (02:39 - 02:46): No. Case that Architecture Remodeling or RC Home Services and Remodeling. Familiar with those guys?
Speaker B (02:46 - 02:46): What about them?
Speaker A (02:46 - 03:11): No, it doesn't work right now, 75% of people, when they go online, calling these guys because they're being recommended by Google. Right. They have good visibility. Okay, so that's basically the same type of visibility you want to give you, sir. All right? That's what you specialize in. You never try. I mean, I know you mentioned you haven't done any type of marketing before. Derek, do you have any social media accounts, at least something organic you built up so far?
Speaker B (03:11 - 03:13): Nope. Just out of the Yelp page the last week.
Speaker A (03:13 - 03:34): Oh, Yelp. Okay. There you go. You have yups. Com, right? It's good. So basically, Yelp is good. Search on organic listing. Think about it. Like, people have to have to type in your business to find you on here. Because realistically, Derek, think about this, right? If you want to search up a service, restaurant, or any type of thing you need right away, if I was to ask you, Derek, what type of app do you use normally yourself or like, search engines?
Speaker B (03:34 - 03:35): My phone. Sure.
Speaker A (03:36 - 03:53): Please. The Internet. Right. The Google. Right. The Google Maps, Yahoo. Bean Safari, Apple. Right. Let me ask you this. What would you think can possibly happen if I make sure your company name's showing up on the front page, too? Derek, the modeling is showing up on the front page every single time someone searches up our modeling service. And they can find you up there.
Speaker B (03:53 - 04:05): Sure. I'll be straight with you. You are the fifth person to call me today alone to offer me, like, improved marketing and online business. The fifth person today. I had four people call me yesterday.
Speaker A (04:05 - 04:10): Oh, from my. I'm sorry, this is the first time we're calling you. Right. Probably a different company was trying to reach out to you, right?
Speaker B (04:10 - 04:14): Yeah. So, yeah, I'm losing my patience with these marketing calls.
Speaker A (04:15 - 04:21): Obvious answer. Look, I'm not going to say there's more than 1,000 companies that do the same. Right. But.
Speaker A (04:23 - 04:51): Difference would be probably the explanation or the way we work. We all work a little bit different. Our company started from Google. Derek. We often work with 10,000 business owners just like you and expanded our customer base and Teddy solutions through our online prizes. And basically, Derek, I know you had a lot of phone calls so far, but I can give you just information and that way you're ready to have this competition give us a call and that way it can be better for you. Okay, sure. Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.

Doing good. Thank you for asking me, sir. Appreciate you.
I just want to ask, sir, this is call you, Mike.
I'm looking for a viable business just like you that wants to take on customer so we can work with.
And that's because, Mike, we've seen a surge of people online searching up handyman services in Washington.
So we just want to ask a few questions to see if you can be a good fit.
Go ahead.
Yeah, appreciate you, man.
Look, uh, you guys only do handyman work. What kind of work do you guys usually do? Is it most likely like concrete repairs, installation, or or, um, you guys do complete like models too?
Do complete remodels, general repairs, service work.
Perfect. I understand. Ada told me that you guys have been in the trade for 30 years now, right, sir?
That's correct.
And many years for more for to come, right, sir? Congratulations.
This is something you guys been working hard for, a lot of work, right?
At the moment, Mike, you guys get people that call you through only recommendations or you have like marketing that helps you stay busy and get customers.
Yeah, we do we do some marketing.
Yes, sir, what kind of ads have you been working with?
We work with different ones. We get a lot of referrals too. Who what ads are you working with?
I specifically my company's called Forward Local, Mike. We specialize in Washington to show the search results in the internet where we connect business owners, small and big business owners connect with more new clients through our online presence.
It's been 1,026 searches in the past 30 days for Washington for handyman services.
My goal here is to make you visible in front of these instant customers so they could potentially call you more.
Not all of them, Mike, because there's a bunch of competition, but give you a tiny piece on that kick, uh, a kick too, you know?
Is that something you've been interested in, Mike?
I mean, everybody wants more business, but again, Right? when you say clicks, how much are the clicks? How much, you know, there's things that that happens.
It's not for clicks.
You know what I mean?
We don't charge you believe. We don't charge you for click. It's unlimited with us, because once we work with these type of online visibility, sir, I'm going to make sure people find you directly, right? But it's not for lead.
Um, by visibility, what I mean by that, Mike, um, I don't know if you've ever heard of Van Dam Handyman, LLC here in Washington, or, um, Ace Handyman Services, or Jim the Handyman.
Perfect.
Well, I've heard of Ace.
You serious? They're kind of, you know, they they're out there. You've been out there too, you know.
But not that the word because right now 75% of the people when they go online search up a handyman, they call these guys because they advertise with Google, they have good they're going to have they got a good visibility, right?
So that that the is that I want to give you the same visibility.
That's what I specialize in, okay? You mentioned earlier you have online app, sir. Have you never made a website?
Yeah, we have a website.
Oh, okay. Well, I wasn't aware of that. I'm sorry. What's the name of it?
Brazilian Contractors.
Brazilian Contracting?
Okay.
Mhm.
I found it. Thank you, sir.
That's uh, I think it's not being optimized for now, right? It seems like kind of organic, but it's a good thing you guys made it already, right?
So imagine this, Mike, right? Imagine you have the best website in the world, but not many people look at it.
It's no good, right? It's like having a billboard like in the middle of the desert, right?
What I want to do for you is put you in the middle of a highway where everyone's going to see it.
Now, you might think I don't need customers now.
Think about this think about the branding here, Mike. Imagine 30 years in business, how many people called you back and recommending you already? So many, right?
So, imagine if at least 5% of them was to give you good review, talk about good and good and new in your business, and then it's going to create instant credibility because, you know, something good to look out for yourself, Mike, and too, it's where your new vice speaker, right? It's going to stay with you, okay?
So, we've been in business since 2017, Mike, for local working hard to 70,000 business owners, and we tailor solutions on expanding your customer base and branding too, okay?
What I want to do for you today, Mike, is very simple.
I want to sign you to our IT professionals who are going to build the marketing for you so you will have to.
And one of the goal is is add you on the front page Google on the list of five keywords services you provide. All right? Imagine this, Mike.
If somebody wants to type in residential, uh, repair or handyman services nearby me, my area, we're going to make sure they see you on the show above any competition you have, okay?
Um, I know you're uh I know you're you like to work, Mike.
You don't focus on much on what I'm going to tell you probably, but do you have like pictures and videos of the jobs you do before and after?
Um, anything you like to show your customers?
There you go.
Oh.
That's perfect.
That's what we want to show them, you know? You want to show them your pictures and videos of the jobs you do before and after.

We used to use the yellow phone book that have like phone numbers.

The evolution of the yellow page are only directories.

Yeah, 10th of January and then each 10th of each month, automated recurring.
Meaning that we charge you after we work for it.
And those 182.99 each month, Mike, regardless if you get 10, 20, 30, 30 leads, five jobs, two two jobs, there's no commission of percentages at all for you, sir. Now, let me ask you this, right?

This is just perfect for you because our company Summers, we specialize in monitoring the traffic of search trends online. And the main reason that we called, because we're seeing increase in demand and the number of people that are looking and are searching for your type of service. In fact, for the past 30 days in the area for pressure washing, there's about 865 number of searches from people that are looking for your type of service. They just can't find you yet. That's why they cannot reach you. If I can put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested and are already looking for the service, for sure that will be very beneficial for the company, right?

Speaker A (03:46 - 03:46): No.
Speaker C (03:46 - 03:51): How about Pain and Pressure Cleaning llc? Does it ring a bell?
Speaker A (03:51 - 03:52): No.
Speaker C (03:53 - 04:18): Well, to be honest, I don't know them. I'm just asking because these are the companies right now in the area that I'm seeing on the first page getting the phone call and I don't see your company name here yet. That's why we called you, because we want to put your name front and center above them. That way customers can reach you directly. Especially today, over 80% of people are going online to look for what they need, even clothing.
Speaker A (04:18 - 04:27): Yeah, but I have an agent working with me on all of that stuff. I'm supposed to be getting my webpage and everything designed tomorrow afternoon and stuff.
Speaker A (04:29 - 04:34): I have emailed. I just did Power Washington for Florida.
Speaker B (04:34 - 04:37): Well, that's even great, Thomas. Of course.
Speaker C (04:37 - 04:40): Adam, I'm not here to change whatever you have, whatever you could be doing.
Speaker B (04:41 - 04:42): Just for you to really see and.
Speaker C (04:42 - 04:47): Then compare of what we can do better here. And if you don't like it, I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
Speaker B (04:47 - 04:49): So let me tell you about Sphere.
Speaker C (04:49 - 05:46): Real quick and how exactly this works. So again, our company summit is 411Locals, one of the largest SEO companies in the country. We're one of the handful of certified Google partners worldwide. So we've been doing this for 18 years now and we've already helped over 70,000 customers. And coding, they've stayed with us year in, year out. It's not because they have to, but because they're making money and they're happy with what they're getting. So what we're going to do, we build you a complete online presence that covers any way new customers would look for online. So just imagine this. Anytime new customers would go online, when they go to Google and they search for a reliable pressure washer in the area, or if they search for a pressure washing company near me, we make sure not so much that they see your business name, your phone number and your website front and center above your competition.
Speaker B (05:46 - 05:48): So Thomas, what do you think will.
Speaker C (05:48 - 05:54): Happen if it's always your name and your phone number customers will find whenever they need the service?
Speaker A (05:54 - 05:54): Great.
Speaker C (05:55 - 06:03): What do you think will happen or what do you think they'll do if it's your name and your phone number they're gonna see you and they're gonna find whenever they need to wash in.
Speaker C (06:05 - 06:09): Okay, for sure. That will give you the opportunity to call you directly.
Speaker B (06:09 - 06:10): Right.
Speaker C (06:10 - 06:12): And that means more than right.
Speaker B (06:13 - 06:17): So how we do that for you first is we put your company on.
Speaker C (06:17 - 06:25): The first page of Google under the services you provide and the services that make you the most money. And that's what we guarantee here.
Speaker B (06:25 - 06:29): So even if customers don't know you, even if they don't know your business.
Speaker C (06:29 - 06:39): Name, but whenever they search and they type in the services or the keyword, your company automatically pops up and they will call you naturally, because they're going to see as the best.
Speaker B (06:40 - 06:42): Now, as a business owner, pretty much.
Speaker C (06:42 - 06:45): You see the value of getting reviews from your customers.
Speaker B (06:46 - 06:46): Right?
Speaker C (06:47 - 06:47): Right.
Speaker A (06:47 - 06:48): Absolutely.
Speaker C (06:48 - 06:50): So that's what you do best here.
Speaker B (06:50 - 06:52): So we're going to make it easier.
Speaker C (06:52 - 06:55): For all of your customers to be able to put reviews for you.
Speaker B (06:56 - 06:58): Now these reviews are right there on.
Speaker C (06:58 - 07:08): The first page listing. So once someone puts their view on what a great or awesome job you did, then that's an instant credibility. Then customers will choose you over your competition.
Speaker B (07:08 - 07:11): Now, since most of the customers use.
Speaker C (07:11 - 07:19): SM or tablets powered by Google, your company summits will be front and center over Google Maps and Google Voice search.
Speaker B (07:20 - 07:23): Now, part of the package is creating.
Speaker C (07:23 - 07:27): And maintaining your website. In fact, I just created you a sample, I sent it to you, but.
Speaker B (07:27 - 07:28): You'Ve said earlier that you already have.
Speaker C (07:28 - 07:30): A website that's on process.
Speaker B (07:30 - 07:32): And Thomas, if you want to make.
Speaker C (07:32 - 07:39): It to that website. What we're going to do is create a backlink to your website to make sure that it really generates traffic to your business.
Speaker B (07:40 - 07:41): Because, you know, Asami, even if you.
Speaker C (07:41 - 07:49): Have the most beautiful website, but if customers cannot even find and cannot see it, it's not going to do you any good. Am I making sense?
Speaker A (07:49 - 07:50): Yes, I follow you.
Speaker B (07:51 - 07:54): Thank you. So that's why with our program, we.
Speaker C (07:54 - 08:09): Make sure that you have a website fully optimized and designed to be on the first page where everyone can see. Because our system knows exactly what your competitors are doing to get to the first page. And it copies those same best practices for industry.

Speaker A (09:30 - 09:33): But how much is this package? How much is this package?
Speaker B (09:34 - 09:37): Great question. Well, before we get down to that.
Speaker C (09:37 - 09:40): Thomas, before we get down to the most exciting part, well, if you just.
Speaker A (09:40 - 09:47): Told me we could just save all that extra time that you get. You keep reading stuff and wasting the timeline to just get to the point. That way we can hang up.
Speaker C (09:48 - 09:48): Sure.
Speaker B (09:48 - 09:50): Well, we want to earn your business first.
Speaker C (09:50 - 09:55): We want to prove to you, Thomas, what we're capable of in terms of helping out your business. So today.

Speaker C (10:10 - 10:15): Google, Google Maps and Google Voice search, online directories and phone book listings.
Speaker B (10:16 - 10:19): So 49 and 99, that's the setup.
Speaker C (10:19 - 10:25): Fee to get you started and will show you how exactly the program works. And then after a month.
Speaker B (10:25 - 10:26): Sit with me.
Speaker A (10:26 - 10:38): You know what I look, everything, I got everything set up for tomorrow. So I mean I don't have to pay for it because I'm already, I already have it all set up because it comes with my LLC and the people that I got helping me.
Speaker B (10:38 - 10:43): That's why, that's why we're not going to change that. If you want to make use of that website, we're going to create a.
Speaker C (10:43 - 10:47): Backlink to that website from us. Sub PCs can also generate traffic to your business.
Speaker B (10:47 - 10:48): So how much are you paying for.
Speaker C (10:48 - 10:50): That though, if you don't mind asking?
Speaker A (10:51 - 11:07): I paid a company to do my, get my llc, my ein number, and they got a web designer and all this stuff going on. So I'm already in the process. I, I'm, I'm just waiting for my paperwork, but they're supposed to be tomorrow. For what?
Speaker B (11:07 - 11:10): For the website alone or for everything that they've done?
Speaker A (11:11 - 11:32): It's a package, it's a package deal that I got. I, I, and they paid for my, my, I paid like 200 bucks and, and they got my, my LLC and I had a priority mail express sent. That was the next year. I got an ein, I have a website, I got an email, they send me a business card, a magnet's on my truck.
Speaker B (11:32 - 11:36): Aside from that, aside from the 200, do you pay monthly as well for.
Speaker C (11:36 - 11:41): The maintenance or it's just one time? They give you the website and then it's yours?
Speaker A (11:41 - 11:43): No, there's not. Yeah, it's mine.
Speaker C (11:43 - 11:50): There you go. So that means they're not optimizing it, they just created the website and give it to you. That's it.
Speaker B (11:50 - 11:52): Because that's how it works with some.
Speaker C (11:52 - 11:53): Other companies out there.
Speaker B (11:53 - 11:55): They create and design you a website.
Speaker C (11:56 - 11:57): Just for the sake of having a website.
Speaker B (11:58 - 12:00): But with our program here, we're not.
Speaker C (12:01 - 12:10): Going to stop by creating your website, but we optimize it. We manage and monitor everything to make sure that every time customers would search.
Speaker B (12:10 - 12:12): For the service, they don't have to.
Speaker C (12:12 - 12:25): Search for your domain, they don't have to search for your company name, but just by typing in the services or the keywords, your website, your company name, your phone number will pop up. That's how we do it for you.
Speaker A (12:25 - 12:41): All right, well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna deal with these people tomorrow. I don't want to pay nothing out the pocket right now. I got a lot of. A lot of expenses that I've been paying the last couple days for this business, and I'm trying to get that taken care of before I make another move with another expense.
Speaker A (12:43 - 12:48): Everybody wants me to pay them to make money, but I'm not making money. You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker B (12:49 - 12:53): Well, to be honest with you, Summer, I'm not even paid with a 49.
Speaker C (12:53 - 13:06): Our company is not making money out of that. We're investing a lot on this campaign just to start with the website we're creating for you. It's not just a simple or basic website here. We're creating a website that is worth $800.
Speaker B (13:07 - 13:09): Optimizing your business on the first page of Google.
Speaker C (13:09 - 13:15): We're investing $300 for that. And then listing your business all in directories and phone book listings.
Speaker B (13:16 - 13:19): Just say you have been kicked from this conference.
Speaker C (13:20 - 13:21): You get lost.

Speaker D (00:25 - 00:50): Yeah, I'm mobile. I do auto body work anywhere basically. So usually I worked with my uncles and my father inside the body shop, but I wind up working on the site for a couple different reasons, for school projects and to help with rent and everything like that. But I've been doing it for a very long time and now I've been doing it for about five years.

Speaker C (01:09 - 01:10): Yes, wonderful. Jake.
Speaker B (01:10 - 01:12): Yeah, I'm calling because we're seeing a.
Speaker C (01:12 - 01:23): Surge of people in your area searching online for auto body repair. And my manager asked me to reach out to a few local business that can actually take on new customers.
Speaker B (01:23 - 01:28): Also, I just want to know like, does it have like an insurance or.
Speaker C (01:28 - 01:29): A lia about your shop?
Speaker E (01:30 - 01:37): Well, no, there's no really shop for it. It's mostly it's only mobile auto body works basically.
Speaker A (01:37 - 01:39): So we go wherever anybody needs to be.
Speaker E (01:40 - 01:42): But if so we do have a.
Speaker A (01:42 - 01:44): Garage and everything that we can support.

Speaker B (01:46 - 01:50): But no, I'm currently not insured on anything that's good. No, no worries about that.
Speaker E (01:50 - 01:53): And just really just a small business.
Speaker A (01:54 - 02:01): Like I said, it was just to start up something to help out around the house and help out with some bills and stuff.
Speaker C (02:01 - 02:02): Okay, perfect to hear that.
Speaker B (02:02 - 02:05): Yeah. And just to be clear, we're not looking for work.
Speaker C (02:05 - 02:09): We help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service.
Speaker B (02:09 - 02:12): It's about reviewing your local business for.
Speaker C (02:12 - 02:18): Potential placement in front of real customer searches. So my manager just confirms which one.
Speaker B (02:18 - 02:25): Fits the criteria and like even for example, any season. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker E (02:25 - 02:27): Yeah, any season, any time.
Speaker A (02:27 - 02:36): And really. And the thing about this, when we work, it's all about what the damage is so we can come out, give a good estimate, but it's better off.
Speaker D (02:36 - 02:39): For us to give estimates over the phone because for us to come up.
Speaker A (02:39 - 02:44): There and like for me to come up to do free estimate only is hard.
Speaker B (02:44 - 02:49): Okay, Correct, correct. I understand you, Jake. Yeah. By the way, Jake, I have my.

Speaker B (00:03 - 00:19): Okay. Correct. Correct. I understand you, Jake. Yeah. By the way, Jake, I have my manager here who asked me to call you Ismael. We have Jake under autobadgerik. It's currently mobile and has a website and 5 years experience in the business. Okay, that's great.
Speaker A (00:19 - 00:20): Yes.
Speaker B (00:20 - 00:21): Hi Jake, how are you today?
Speaker A (00:21 - 00:23): Hi, how are you doing today?
Speaker B (00:23 - 00:27): I'm doing well, thank you for asking and thank you. I'm doing good. How about you?
Speaker A (00:27 - 00:30): I'm doing great. Just got done working a little bit.
Speaker B (00:31 - 01:27): Okay. Okay then. Well, as one of my uncle says, no, as long as we are with health and we have job to do, we are in the best way. Now tell me on this way. So Jake, let me introduce myself again. As my assistant said, my name is Ismael, I'm managing my company that is 411 local. The reason that I asked my assistant to contact me with you Jake is because. Well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business on this way so that we can work together. Because well, on the area there's a great increase on the demand of customers that are looking for automotive service. And well, as you know now all the season and people are starting to do some things to the cars and everything. So that's what I would like to do is to see the way that we can put you in front of all of these customers and then that this will be on the best benefit. Because imagine Jake, that you know that we're in a great city and right now we have more than 1500 customers month by month looking for this service. And you can be there for all of these people that will be as much beneficial, right?
Speaker A (01:27 - 01:48): Yeah, for sure it might take some time depending on the jobs of course. But we're quick and efficient and most of the time we're same day service. Everything, everything gets done the same day. No matter if it's a part that we put on or see just dense dents, scratches.
Speaker B (01:50 - 02:05): Yeah, depending on the thing that we are about to fix or what we are going to do on the car. Because you know, sometimes they're just additions or they want to put special day or they want to change something about the system. So it depends on the job price.
Speaker A (02:05 - 02:12): It all depends on the job and on the street prices vary depending on like what it looks like, how long.
Speaker B (02:12 - 02:13): You take.
Speaker A (02:15 - 02:25): What is like the entire job of it really what's the effort that's going to be put in. But no matter what, it's known to be cheaper than really any body shop is going to give you.
Speaker B (02:25 - 03:01): Oh, and that's one of the great things about your business that you can get great prices now going on this way. Jake, tell me. So I heard from my system that you have a web, that you do, but on this time that you've been running this business that my assistant told me that you have been on five years of business. The way that you manage to get new customers for you and the way that new prospects will be able to find you so that you are trying to keep you as busy as possible. How you do it on that way, by the recommendations, the word of mouth. You make it mostly by your website, your social media, your business cards, flyers, how you do it?
Speaker A (03:01 - 03:09): Well, mostly I go around and I look for jobs and if I see somebody that has some damage, I ask but also.
Speaker A (03:11 - 03:37): Yes, I give them cards or if I also will go and give them. Now my website and my auto body work ads on Facebook doesn't really give me that much business because most of the time people don't really go to them and it's just, it takes a long time for them to work. They're a little bit inconsistent. But mostly it's about, it's a lot of groundwork, if you know what I mean.
Speaker B (03:37 - 03:45): Yeah, yeah, I completely understand everything that you're saying because yeah, you need to do the groundwork to have good results and benefits, right?
Speaker A (03:45 - 03:46): Yeah. Well, most of the time.
Speaker A (03:48 - 04:05): I'll go around, I'll walk around maybe or I'll drive around somewhere and I'll find cars, I'll find damage somewhere and I'm able to fix it wherever they need to be. I'll have tools on me prepared. And also there's more tools at the house too that I can always get and come back.
Speaker B (04:06 - 04:15): Okay. Okay. And now going on this week, what are the type of loops that you prefer to do the most? Like directly from particular car owners or you can do also commercial.
Speaker A (04:15 - 04:28): I could do commercial services too. Any, any type of car that has damage on it I'm able to fix. But mostly it's only auto body work mechanically wise, not too much.
Speaker B (04:29 - 04:40): A little bit though, just a little bit. Not very in turn to the mechanical, more of the brace transmission oil change.
Speaker A (04:40 - 05:07): I can do oil change, maybe to change a starter, a couple different things, but nothing really much because mostly cosmetic work I'll do. It's like damage like dents, scratches, repaint and if anybody wants anything else too, like additions like if they want to do some kind of custom thing too that works. Just depends.
Speaker B (05:09 - 05:18): Okay. Okay. So then on these Services that you do. So then the ones that you do the most. What are the ones that you can say that you can do the most? Like for an example, the five services that you do the most.
Speaker A (05:18 - 05:39): The five services I do the most is dent, prepare, scratch, repair, paint. And that would be mostly. Mostly those things are most of what you see a lot just scratches. Dents, rust is one too. I work on all types of wax.
Speaker B (05:39 - 05:40): Maybe like a detail.
Speaker A (05:41 - 05:57): Yeah, detail works as well. But it's a little bit more rare than the other ones because most people don't really want to do their car with wax and stuff because it takes longer. But depending on the situation, it has happened. It does happen.
Speaker B (05:57 - 07:10): Okay. Okay. And that's great. Okay. So then let me tell you what we would like to do on this way, Jake. So the way that we want to work together is that we can be working as a team. So the way that we can make it for the best for the business. So right. That we can just be and set everyone on a specialty. For example, that you can be in charge of the presence, the optimization, the maximum exposure for your business. On the way that when all of these thousands of customers are looking or searching for the services that you do, the option that they always have find and get it will be you and your business. And then on this way so that this will be as reflected on success, growment, but mostly of course money. And then on this way for sure that you will be success and growing. And of course if you grow, we will be ingrained directly with you because well, that means that you are happy with the service that you and on this way that these customers the only thing that you will be in charge on them date it will be of picking up your phone, making the job, getting the payment from the customers and of course doing the things that I know that you can do the best that is to bring your customers a quality service and to make your customers happy. Right. And then on that list they will be coming back when they need a new job and of course that they can become great.
Speaker A (07:10 - 07:22): Yeah, for sure. Recommendations to friends is also a big way that a lot of time inside of work because people like the job. Then they go up to another person in their family.
Speaker B (07:22 - 07:31): Yeah. And their friends and everything. And you know, as the way that they said that my work will speak by my. And then with the great job, I work for itself.
Speaker A (07:31 - 07:39): They don't pay until after the job is done. So that they're cured on everything if they like it. If they're not satisfied with the work.
Speaker B (07:39 - 08:02): Then we just take it and give the answer. That's great. That's a very great way that you manage it because it's something that you can give as a complete way that they can feel comfortable and they can feel good with the service because that's a good guarantee. If you don't like what you get, you're not paying. And of course, because you are completely confident about your service, you know that the customers love it.
Speaker A (08:02 - 08:03): Of course.
Speaker B (08:03 - 08:16): Yeah. Right, Jake then. Now Jake, tell me so on this business that you have on your own, how would be the way that you would like to show your business on the first place? How do people find it? What's the name that you are looking to get for your business?
Speaker A (08:17 - 08:21): Well, on my website I have Jack, but that's just my second name.
Speaker A (08:22 - 08:28): So I can give you, I would just say maybe Jake's Auto Body Repairs.
Speaker B (08:28 - 09:05): Okay, Repairs. Okay, that's great. And then for the service, let me tell you then the way that we work and this way Jake, is that because we are as you do it, we are a performance based company. So that means that we always show you everything that we are creating, everything that we are doing and building for you and that you can check on real time, what you are getting for and the benefits that this is giving you. So then happy with the service provided, as you said, we can continue working as much time as possible, right? And then of course that if you are happy with the service, you can continue as long term relationship that we're looking for. Right?
Speaker A (09:06 - 09:08): Yeah, that sounds great now.
Speaker B (09:08 - 09:45): And that's the reason that my service is a fast paced service. But on that way, for the service that we do is that you will be paying only for the service rendered to you, but on the month before. So for example, if once you pay your service right now on this way, so you will be paying your first monthly payment until January 10th and then on January you are paying for the service rendered from today to January 10th. Then the next month on February 10th, you are paying for January 30th. On the, on March you are paying for February, an interest for March and that will be the same every single month. Right?
Speaker A (09:45 - 09:46): Okay.
Speaker B (09:46 - 09:47): Because well.
Speaker A (09:49 - 09:58): So how much would it be like, so let's say I start up service now and everything like that. So how much would it be? How much would it be next month?
Speaker B (09:58 - 10:26): Okay. For the service that we have right now also that's the great thing that I was about to mention you because right now we have been outright for your service on your area over There that now we have an excellent promotion that we are giving you for a limited time right now that it will be just that we are giving you more than 50% of discounts on the service for your business. But just to confirm on that way that I have the right information. Can you confirm your zip code please Jake?
Speaker A (10:26 - 10:32): 32713 I believe the branding X real quick.
Speaker B (10:33 - 10:35): Yeah, no worries. If I can confirm that my.
Speaker B (10:39 - 10:42): 703-327-03.
Speaker A (10:42 - 10:43): Yes.
Speaker B (10:43 - 10:52): Yeah, yeah, that's the one that. Okay. And this is on a popcorrect. Yes. Okay, so now on this area, what do we have on the service?
Speaker B (10:54 - 10:57): You said that you have your own shop, right?
Speaker A (10:58 - 11:08): Well, mostly it's just like it's where I live and stuff. I can bring the cars to my garage and I can work on them there depending on the situation.
Speaker A (11:10 - 11:20): If they want me to do that. But most of the time I do everything same day anywhere that they're at, I'm able to at their home, at their work, wherever they have to be.
Speaker B (11:20 - 11:26): Yeah, yeah, I understand. So maybe we can make it like an outer registration service, huh? And as we said.
Speaker A (11:29 - 11:46): It'S all about mobile and also wherever they have to be. But also if they need it to be that way, it's a long job at limited time. I could always take it back to the house and they can even keep their keys and everything like that.
Speaker B (11:46 - 12:07): Okay, okay, okay. So just going on the way and we were looking to make, you know the special promotion that we have available for you. Right on this way. What we have now available that I mentioned is that we are giving you more than 50% of the discount a month. It will be just $304 with 90.
Speaker A (12:07 - 12:09): Okay, that's great.
Speaker B (12:10 - 14:19): Yeah. And also that will be a race rate that it won't change anytime. It doesn't matter how many jobs you do a month or how many times we'll be working together on this way. So the rate won't change at any time. And also my rate is a free trade. That means that it will be the same every moment for you. Then as we said that it will be a postpaid service. So that means that your first monthly payment will be until January 10th. So right now then to make it on this way for you, the next step is just to make the activation because I'm not going to ask you right for the service on your payment directly for the monthly payment until January 10th. Right now the only thing that we are asking from you on this way, Jay, it's just an activation Set of fee but also just to make you know, this is something that we are doing on the easiest way possible for you that as we said that it will be on the lowest rate for your business. And then we are asking you just purchase the 1% of your trust on the way that let me show you how I gained the additional percent from you just based on the facts, the numbers and the benefits and the performance that you've been looking on my way so that on this way that we can make it for you. So we are just asking you for activation one time instead of fee that is only for on this way, $49.99. That's just the only one that we are going to ask you. Nothing more than that. And then that's the only activation service that we are about to ask you on that just to start creating everything for you. And also let me tell you right now on this way for this service that will be growing on that for you so that we can make it for the service. And also my manager right now is coming up to me and it has tell me that just because we want you to help you and to make this on the best benefit for your business, he's authorizing an additional discount on your monthly rate directly, Jake. So that he's giving US instead of 304, we are putting on your business for the rate only for $263. So if she's giving us more than $40 of discount for life, that's your rate. It will stay always only on 263. And then just make it happen for you and to of course make it on the best way possible for you.
Speaker A (14:19 - 14:27): Okay. And now I have, I have a little bit of a. What would you think if we was to do this?
Speaker A (14:29 - 14:46): What do you think if we was to do this? I know this is maybe it's a little bit of a crazy idea. What if we was to do that every job that I did and everything that I can give you guys about let's say 30 to 40% of that job.
Speaker B (14:46 - 16:44): Oh, I know what you're saying. So let me tell you and thank you for thinking, but just let me tell you. So we don't work by commission. We don't work by percentage or by amount. And also just let me tell you the way that you say just to make it happen that you said that you give me like I don't know, 30 or 40%. Let's thought that you do 20 jobs right on a month. Correct. So and maybe the job, it could be like for $400, right. Each job. So you will be doing $4,000. And if you give me 30% of $8,000, so that will be completely so much more than what I gave you for the monthly rate. Right? So maybe that won't help you so much because right now on my monthly rate, I'm giving you just $263.99. But also it's a postpaid service that your monthly payment, it will be until January 10th and then every 10 of every month on a postpaid survey. So that means that you are doing this on a month in delay. And for the other way, if you do a job, you will be needed to give me like also, we don't work like that, but just make the supposition. So you will be needed to give me so much more than that. Because, for example, for a job that is for $400, you will be needed to give me like 120. And then on two jobs you are giving me more than the monthly rate that I'm giving you. Right. And just on two jobs, and imagine if you do 10 jobs, you will be giving me like $1,000. So that will not help you. Right. And if we do it like on this way and you do 10, 20, 30 or 40 jobs, I'm not going to ask you nothing from that because the only thing that I'm going to ask you is just for a monthly payment that is a free grade. And also as we said, it's based on performance and on the service that you will be doing. And as you said, if you're happy with the service, of course we can continue working as much time as possible. Right. And we can give you the extent and we can guarantee you the maximum exposure for your business on the way that imagine if there are thousands of customers looking for this service and you can be there for all of them, what do you think that will happen?
Speaker A (16:44 - 16:48): Yeah, I think that's great. I think that it sounds right now.
Speaker B (16:48 - 16:58): Just to make it happen, it's less than $50. That will be something very great. You will see everything based on the performance and the benefit that you are looking.
Speaker A (16:58 - 17:16): Yes. And the only, the only thing is I would like to call you right back. I like to talk to a few people and just make sure. Because right now I don't have as much on me at the moment to do the thing to do everything to activate it.
Speaker B (17:18 - 17:20): You don't have available 49?
Speaker A (17:20 - 17:29): Not at the moment. Because right now, I'm also right now a little bit due on rent and stuff. I'm putting in money with my family.
Speaker B (17:30 - 17:45): So Brent, you can think that you can be able to get the 49. Because if you want, the thing that we can do right now is to make a postpaid service. That means that just to secure the spot and to save the unlock the rate that I gave you, we will just make.
Speaker B (17:47 - 18:28): Postpaid service that it will be just for $1. So I think that you can have $1 and then he will secure the spot and save it for you. And then if you tell me for an example, no, tomorrow at three, you will have it ready. So the payment will be done tomorrow at the time that you tell me. But right now we are securing the spot for you just with $1. And then we can make it happen. I will give you the information, we verify everything. And then tomorrow you said that you have the money available, the payment will be done for tomorrow. Just an example, right. And then so the service will be activated for you just with the $49.99. But right now, just to secure it and keep it for you, we can make it just with $1. So do you think that you can be able to make it with $1?
Speaker A (18:28 - 18:40): Yeah, I think I can send it on now. The only thing is my only form of really money right now inside of I can only really use cash app right now.
Speaker B (18:41 - 18:55): No, we have only used with debit or credit cards. That's the only way that we also you don't need to grab basically the code. You can maybe your app or you can add your card number. We can do it on there, but it will be just with debit or credit and just with one.
Speaker A (18:56 - 19:02): Yeah. Well, is there any way that I can get back to you guys in a little bit and I will let you guys know.
Speaker B (19:02 - 19:18): So tell me just that we can be with completely commitment of both ways. Tell me ask what time it will be good for you and then I will give you a call but in an honest way so that you can send me your know, if you call me on that time, I will be available and I will seek.
Speaker A (19:19 - 19:31): Okay, well, I'm gonna stay maybe around. So what time is it for you? What's. What's the free time that you have? Like maybe. Maybe tomorrow and.
Speaker A (19:32 - 19:34): Maybe in the tomorrow morning.
Speaker B (19:35 - 20:19): Yeah, if you tell me tomorrow morning but in a completely honest way because just I will let you know. Normally we don't work Saturdays, but if you tell me that you are able to do it tomorrow, I will pay so that they can let me go to the office to make it for you and I will be available for you to. Because this spot, we only have it available for this week and if we let it pass from this week, so it won't be available. But if you send me that tomorrow, it will be completely honestly available for you. I will ask for permission to go to the office tomorrow to make it for you. So tell me that way completely honestly how we can do it and the time that it will be good for you and I will be making it to help you on that way for tomorrow. If you tell me we're completely honestly.
Speaker A (20:21 - 20:25): Maybe around tomorrow, around three, would that be okay?
Speaker B (20:25 - 20:30): So three in the morning. But then you said in the afternoon at three.
Speaker A (20:30 - 20:31): Yeah, in the afternoon.
Speaker B (20:31 - 20:32): I think.
Speaker B (20:33 - 20:50): Tomorrow at three. Yeah, I can do it for you. So. But I can have your commitment so that if I can call you, you can answer me for me and then I can ask for permission to be on the office and we can make it tomorrow. But tomorrow you will be doing the activation or just the one drop will.
Speaker A (20:50 - 20:59): Be the $49.99 if I. Yeah, I just need to make the decision my family and make sure that everything is good, whatever it is. So.
Speaker B (21:00 - 21:23): Okay. Also right now I am sending you a text message this way, Jake, with all my company information with my website so that you can check it on your own. And then tomorrow when we speak again, you have also that from you. I give you the information but I want you to have it on your own way and that you can check it by yourself so that we can be on the best way possible and that you are as much informed. Right.
Speaker A (21:23 - 21:24): Okay, that sounds great.
Speaker B (21:26 - 21:42): So just I'm sending you this text message just to know that you get it. Can you please, I don't know, confirm me the text message, I don't know, with an okay or some like saying hi or something right now when you receive it so that I know that you get it and then you can check it anytime you want it and then tomorrow we can speak again.

Speaker B (21:44 - 21:50): Okay, now I send it to you. Tell me please if you get it. So I don't know, answer me with just anything you want so that I can know that you receive it.
Speaker A (21:51 - 21:56): Okay, I'm going to say, hey, this is Jake.

Speaker A (22:16 - 22:19): Yes, my email address is Jakemason.
Speaker B (22:24 - 22:36): You are not going to receive nothing, not police, nothing like that. This is just because the system requires me an email address to set up an appointment for the customers for a callback. Right? Okay, but I'm not going to send you nothing, don't worry.

The number that you can call me is the one that it shows in the body of the message that says my name. Then a phone number and an extension.

Hello.
I'm okay, and you?
I'm doing fantastic.
It's Monday, so better be good, right?
Well, uh, J, this is Johnson.
Uh, thank you so much for reaching us back again.
Um, actually, one of the senior area managers here in 411 locals.
I did try to call you earlier because we're currently seeing several people in your local area who are currently searching and looking for your services right now.
And pretty much we're looking for a refutable handyman that we can actually feature in front of those interested people.
So just wanted to ask you a few questions to make sure you would be a good fit, okay?
Okay.
Uh, J, you are the owner of the business, correct?
Yes.
I'm self-employed, yeah.
Perfect.
And J, can you please tell me more about your business?
Like how long have you been running your own business now?
And what, when you do get new customers, what type of jobs right now usually you want more of or what makes you the most money?
Well, the most jobs I would know is like in between painting, carpentry, and drywall, hanging drywall and painting.
Mm-hmm.
And how long have you been running the business now?
I've been doing this for about 15, 20, almost 20 years now.
Oh, wow.
Congratulations.
So pretty much I'm speaking with an expert then, I would say, right?
Yes.
Perfect.
And I do, um, I do some, I do small, small plumbing and electric too.
Just, just my, Okay. the basic, the basic electric and plumbing work.
All right, perfect.
That's good to hear.
And, uh, are you mainly doing it residentially or you're also open to do commercial jobs as well?
I do, I do mostly, mostly private, but I could do, I do commercial whenever, whenever available.
All right, perfect, perfect.
And so far so good.
Um, how far are you willing to travel for jobs or how many mile radius are we looking at?
It, it go, it depend on how, how soon I'm contacted.
I could go to Falls Church, Virginia, Maryland, Clinton, any, any, any, any, any part in the DMV, any area, long, long as I'm contact, long as I have the information in advance, as long as I'm contacted, you know, in a timely matter where I could get to these places.
Because like I said, I'm in the district, I'm in DC.
Mhm.
I live in the district.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Oh, wow.
So pretty much you can travel where the money is, I would say, right?
Yeah.
All right.
That's perfect.
Yes.
I see.
But the business is, uh, originally located in what city and zip code again?
Washington, DC.
Uh-huh, and what's the zip code?
20019.
19.
Okay, thank you.
And so far so good, J.
I'm pretty sure you're still open to take on more jobs for your business, correct?
Yes.
I see.
Well, here's the thing, J.
The reason why I ask you that question is because again, like what I told you, we've been seeing a lot of people in your local area, specifically in Washington, DC, in the city of Washington, DC, that are currently looking for handyman services, most importantly for painting, carpenter and drywall.
And actually in the past 30 days alone, out of that 574,000 population in Washington, DC, there is already a total of 38,238 total monthly search in the past 30 days alone, currently searching and looking for a refutable handyman.
So if I could put your business in front of those interested people, searching and looking for your services, that would be something very, very beneficial, right?
Okay.
Yes.
I see.
Uh, so far so good, J.
I'm just curious to know, you mentioned you've been this, uh, this business for a long time now, but how do most of your customers usually find you?
Is it online or just word of mouth?
They can find me online and then and then they pass word word to mouth.
They pass it on to other people throughout, um, throughout the region.
That's how I've been getting business.
I see.
That's great to hear.
So pretty much that speaks to the quality of your work and that's one of the things that we're looking for someone who provides handyman service in Washington.
Here's what we do, J.
When people search online for handyman services in the city of Washington, DC, they usually don't type in the business name.
They just search for the service, like painter near me, or the best carpenter, or drywall services here in Washington, DC.
Right.
Okay.
Right?
And if you're not showing up, I understand. your competitors are getting those phone calls.
Have you ever heard about VanDam handyman LLC?
Do you know them?
No.
Um, how about Handyman of DC One LLC?
Does it ring a bell?
That bring a bell.
I see.
Maybe you also haven't heard about Clappinberger and Son and Capital Hill Handyman Solutions.
Does that also ring a bell?
No.
No.
I haven't, I haven't heard of that.
But I think I've seen it online before somewhere.
I see.
Well you see, J, uh, these are actually, Sorry?
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
Go ahead.
Right.
Sorry to interrupt you, J.
Now, you see, J, I don't want you to mind them, but why this matters is because these are actually the businesses that are getting now the big checks out of those already interested people looking for painter, carpenter or drywall contractor.
It's not because they're better than you, J, but obviously speaking it's because they are more visible and easy to be found online.
Right.
Uh, you know, you see since the COVID pandemic had happened, almost 84% of people nowadays don't usually talk to their neighborhoods anymore when they're looking for something.
That's right.
They will just pull up their phone, go online and find what they wanted to buy.
And those people are now getting and dominating the area.
You know, that's the tough part, J.
You may be the best option for customers, but if they can't find you, they will just jump off and pure competitors are getting those phone calls.
And that is the reason why we're here, J, because what we do here at 411 Locals is to make sure that your business shows up any time of the day in front of those customers, so the calls and the jobs comes to you instead of someone else.
And I'm pretty sure that would be something that will be beneficial for your business, right J?
Right.
Yes.
Right.
Um, what's the name of your business, J?
I don't have no real big name or nothing like that.
Just, just, just J hand, just J the handyman.
Right.
J the handyman.
I see.
Okay, that's a good name already.
All right, not a problem.
Well, J, I don't know, I don't know if you've heard about our business before, but our company is called 411 Locals.
We're actually one of the fastest growing full-fledged advertising companies in the country.
Uh-huh.
We are also a certified Google partners.
We have a four star rating on Google.
And J, I'm not bragging, but we have helped over 70,000 business owners, small to medium sized business owners like yours.
Wait a minute.
what is 411.
I'm, I'm, I didn't mean to cut you off.
What is 411 lookout?
And most of them are what is this 411?
Oh, no.
411 Look.
I know.
Let me send you our website.
Is this number textable?
You can receive a text message?
Yes.
Yeah, let me send it to you, sir.
That's our official website and our certification coming from you, Google.
You got it?
Okay.
Uh, did you receive it?
Okay.
I got 702291.
Yeah.
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah, that's the our official website and our Google partner badge.
You can put me in speaker phone while you're, you're opening those links, but pretty much what, again, we will do the marketing for you.
So really all you got to do here, J, is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
And I'm pretty sure you can do that, right?
Correct?
Right.
Yes.
Now, the first thing that we will do here, J, is the most important part, which is to put your business on the front page placement on Google under five of your services that you mainly provide.
Let me ask you this, J.
Okay.
When was the last time you used Google to search for something?
Oh, it's been a while.
Right.
But it's been a while.
But when you use Google, were you able to find what you're looking for?
Most of the time, yes.
Right.
Well, it's because J, Google is the money maker.
Well, based on his researchers and studies, Right, exactly.
84% of people nowadays are using Google.
And here's the kicker, J.
94% of those people don't even past the first page results.
Right.
I don't know if they go to the 10th page or the bottom page of Google, but when I'm looking for something, I go directly that is the one that is highly suggested on the front page.
And that's the reason why we're putting you on there.
Because once you are on the front page of Google, J, you are naturally going to get calls since people associate the businesses on the first page as being the best anyway.
J, do you have some photos of jobs you did?
Uh, before and after photos?
I have them back at the house with my other phone.
I have, yeah, I have a lot of photos.
That's perfect.
Then it's time for you to show it to your customers because those photos is really important to build credibility of the works of the quality of the jobs that you did.
I actually sent you another link to your phone, J, that should be a sample website that I created for your business.
Do you have a website already or not yet?
No, I have, I just have my email and my messages.
You know what?
Can, can you all please, can I, can you do me a favor?
Because I'm in the dentist right now, he just called me.
I'm getting my, um, dentures put in.
Can I, can I, can you call me back about 4:00?
Is that a good time?
I can always, Uh, I can always call you back, J.
That's not going to be a problem, but I'm already done here.
Just wanted to wrap it all so you would have the information regarding everything.
Let me just wrap it all.
Okay, yes, because I'm getting these dentures put in now.
Okay.
I'm listening.
Okay.
Just give me, all right, perfect.
Now, if you could open the link that I sent you right now, J, that should be a sample website, the one that has your phone number, and then you will be routed to a sample website that I created for your business.
You got it open?
You got the link?
I don't have the link.
Let me see.
The one that has your phone number, 411 locals.com/your phone number.
From the same phone number.
Yes, I'm trying to go back there.
I see the text and, uh, let me see.
While you're finding it, J, you can still hear me, correct?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Right.
So pretty much it's, um, again, that website is pretty much customizable based on your preferences.
So if you want to change the colors, if you have some photos that you said you have, then we can actually attach that on the website to make it more enticing so that we can put your best foot forward from your business competition.
And then lastly, Okay.
We guarantee you a full brand maximum explosion.
Okay.
what you got.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
Let's see what you got.
The official website 411 locals.
Google partner.
Okay.
Tapp.
And you did it.
I'm trying to load it now.
I'm trying to load it now.
It said there are many ver, veritables 411 locals.com.
Yeah.
And then, uh, what do you see on the screen?
I see there are many ver, pages and long.
You see the name of your business, J the handyman?
Give free consultation.
Now she's calling me now.
Oh yeah, I see the handyman.
I just don't see my name.
Oh yeah, I see it.
I see J the handyman.
On the top.
Yeah.
Yes.
Do you like it or you don't like it?
You can scroll down for you to see it more.
Yeah.
I like that.
Right.
Okay, perfect.
Now again, um, just let us know what are the modifications that you want us to do here, change the color.
If you have some photos, we can put it on the gallery of photos of the before and after jobs to make it more, um, enticing and professionally done, okay?
And then lastly, J, we guarantee you a full brand maximum exposure online and that is one of the reason why we're also going to be putting your business over 50 online directories.
Okay.
We will put you on Yelp, Manta, Merchant Circle, Super Pages, Yahoo, Bing, Craigslist, basically anywhere online.
And you don't need to pay them separately.
Why?
It's because we want to make sure that wherever the customer would search and look for the services that you specialize and you do, we will make sure that you're going to be showing up there front and center your competition.
All right.
And now, J, out of the three services I mentioned, the Google, the website, or putting your business under 50 online platforms, which one do you think would benefit your business the most?
I guess the Google.
Exactly.
Yes, Google is the the key to success because the higher your Google placement is, the higher recommendation that you would have.
But again, as you can see, J, we use all this following elements that I just mentioned because, uh, to help you establish and maintain a strong online presence, which is so critical these days.
And our ability to generate new customer is why 99% of them really are happy with the results they see.
Now, it's almost impossible not to make money with this program, J, because remember, we reposition your business in front of those interested people who are already searching for your services.
The problem is that they just don't know who you are, right?
J, can you open the last link, uh, the link that says, uh, Google partners?
You got it?
Right.
The Google partner badge, the one with with along with the official website.
Just wanted to show you something.
You got that, right?
I'm trying to find it.
Contact information.
Yes, no, I'm still.
No, just go back to your text message and then you can see there the official website and then Google partner badge.
And then I want you to click the one that says google.com.
I see, I see Google partners badge.
You said click that one?
Or would you like me to send it again to you?
Yeah, you click the link and then you will be routed to a Google website.
Let me know once you're there.
Okay, I'm here.
And what do you see on the screen?
Can you read something for me?
It's kind of small.
Let me see.
Let me large it.
Um.
You got preference then certifications.
Right.
Mhm.
That's correct.
Google Google partners.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Google partners.
Right.
Now, if you can see on the link, I'm looking.
I'm looking.
No, no, no.
Just don't click the, just don't click the link.
Just let it there, okay?
Now, what you're seeing, J, is a Google website.
If you could see the link that you clicked in, it says google.com/partners, it's not our website, J.
It's directly coming from Google, right?
You can also see our name, 411 Locals, and we have met our requirements to be a certified Google partners.
Right.
We also maintain an optimization score of at least 70% indicating that we have set up our clients to perform well, which shows you our ability to actually help our clients consistently and identifying new growth opportunities and sustain their success on an ongoing basis.
Are you following?
Now, I'm showing you this, J, because Google would never ever associate themselves with just anyone.
Yes.
A multi-billion dollar company will never ever compromise their reputation that they built for a long time by being in partners with a non-legit company, right?
Right.
And also from those 900 SEO companies around the US, only five were given the batch.
And we are proud to say that we know exactly how to help you and your business in getting the right exposure you need that will also help you generate the right clients for your business.
So really, we will do the marketing for you, so really all you got to do here is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
And I'm pretty sure you can do that, correct?
Yes.
Correct.
Now, let me ask you this, sir.
How much do you make for one painting job right now?
I know it depends how big the job is, but what is the average cost of one job for you?
The average, like you said, depend on the room, or the house.
If it's a whole house or if it's a room, a whole house, the, the, I could, I could charge about, $2,000 depending on how many stories, how many squares, mm-hmm, okay.
Now, in what?
$2,000.
If we're talking about a $2,000 job, sir, out of the number of searchers right now, let's say if I drive you 40 customers in a month, how many do you think you could do business with if it's a $2,000 job?
Out of the 40 in one month.
40 jobs in a month?
Mhm.
For $2,000.
I could, I could get, uh, most of them done.
Right.
Can you give me a specific number, like realistically speaking?
Like for, um, depend on how many workers I have with me, how many people I got working with me.
So realistically, if it, it was me or another, me and another partner person, mhm.
About, mm.
Now, how many jobs you said?
40?
Um, yeah, 40 in a month.
If ever, if ever so.
40 jobs but how big?
You, you're not telling me how big the job.
$2,000 job.
A $2,000.
A $2,000.
$2,000?
Oh, okay.
Well, about half of it.
I say about half.
All right, 20.
Okay.
That's a good number already.
Now, If we're talking about $2,000 job multiplied by 20, roughly estimation, you make $40,000.
$40,000.
From the exposure we give you, right?
And I'm pretty sure, J, you wouldn't be mad at me.
You're making at least $40,000 every month if you make 20 customers, uh, you wouldn't be mad at me.
And plus you're getting constant flow of new customers calling you every time they need something done.
You wouldn't be mad at me, right?
Yeah, that's definitely, but that's not, that's not, that's not, I would be mad at you, but that's not 100% guaranteed though.
Exactly.
That's not 100% guaranteed.
Exactly.
That is not 100% guaranteed, but what I'm trying to ask you here is just once you receive one single phone call, please do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
Is that something that you can do?
I understand.
I understand, yeah.
I'm going to understand.
Right.
Now, let's say for example you make $40,000 from the exposure we give you.
If I'm going to charge you $600 a month and you're earning $40,000, that should already cover more than the cost of the service and gives you a constant flow of new customers every time they need something done, correct?
Right, right.
Right.
But of course, I'm not going to ask you to pay $600 a month, J, because normally the price of the package that I'm presenting to you from other companies who will offer you this kind of service, it will range from 700 to 1,000 bucks.
But we are giving you a huge discount because we want to earn your business the old fashioned way, which is to show you first results.
I appreciate that.
So that's one of the reason why, Of course.
So with us, for the maintenance fee every month, regardless how much you're making, or regardless how many jobs you get, it's all yours.
We're not going to be asking for any cuts or any commission.
For you to maintain the program instead of $700, it will be only $485.98 flat rate.
But then again, I'm not going to ask you to pay today.
$485.
Yeah, $485.98.
But then again, J, I'm not going to ask you to pay that today.
Remember, we want to earn your business the old fashioned way, which is to show you results, and that's the reason why that monthly payment will start 30 days from today.
To be exact, your billing cycle will be every the 10th of every month, starting on January 10th, and we'll be auto-built as your monthly recurring fee.
But today, J, believe it or not, today you will have to, I have to, I have to, I have to lay down and think about this, okay?
I understand.
And plus, I'm in the dentist right now.
That's why I need you to call me back about 4:00.
I have to get this dentures in my mouth.
But, um, Can I think about this?
Uh, yes, but I'm not yet, uh, finished though.
You know, today I'm only giving you $59.98.
I have to, I have to, I have to.
Oh, okay.
Wow, can't beat that.
Yeah.
But I have to, I have to see this business.
I have, they're calling me now.
I can't miss this.
Can you please, can I have you call me back?
I'm in the dentist office right now.
Yeah, if I call you back later, would you, are you going to pick up the phone or not?
What time can I call you?
Oh yeah, I have to pick it up.
Okay.
Cuz that means I hear some more about this.
About 4:00.
Mm-hmm, is there something that you would like, uh, how likely you would like to proceed with this program?
Um, so interesting.
I need to hear some more though.
I'm sorry?
That's what I need to.
So I would need to hear some more about this company.
That's why I need you to call me back.
What do you want to hear from us then?
Uh, more about the prices.
You were saying this is, is, is, you have a better discount, right?
Yep.
It is.
That's what I can't concentrate right now.
I'm these people fooling with my dog on teeth.
I, you have to call me back at 4:00 because I can't concentrate right now, okay?
I appreciate that.
Just level with me right now if you're not interested or not because if you ask me to call you back, I'll be calling you back until the end of the day here, J.
Okay.
You're calling me back until the end of the day?
Because I spoke with a lot of business owners, J.
They told me to call back, but I never received any of their responses.
So I just want to be sure we are on the same page right now.
Okay.
We're on the same page.
Because my job here is not to.
You said $485 a month for your fee, right?
For your services?
Right, but today you can already start the program.
Exactly.
But for you to get everything started today, it's only going to be $59.98.
Well, just $59 now.
Right.
That's the setup fee to get everything started.
One of the reason why it's only 59.98 today so that at least we can show you results first.
This is a month to month.
We are performance-based company.
So basically the concept we want you to make is which is for you to make money first before we do.
Does that make sense?
It does.
Bottom line is once you are making profit out of the program, obviously you'd stay.
When you stay, then that's how we make money.
So really, all I'm going to be asking from you here is just give me 1% and let me earn the 99% all throughout the process.
Okay, I understand what you're saying.
I have to, I have to think about this.
Okay, that's what I'm, I'm asking you to give me time to think about this also because right now I can't make up my mind.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
In a scale of 1 to 10 right now, how likely would you would like to proceed with this program?
Uh, about six.
How can I make it to 10, sir?
I have to think about it.
That's what I said.
Let me finish with this dentist supporting.
Okay.
And do what I'm doing in here.
Okay, bye-bye.
Okay, then I'll call you at 4:00.
Bye.

Speaker B (00:50 - 01:32): I take on almost all flooring jobs except for I have subcontractors for these type of floorings, epoxy, terrazzo, and any kind of like outdoor. Any kind of outdoor tiling that. That gets engraved or embedded into things. So I outsourced those three items. Everything else was flooring. Wood flooring, carpet, office carpet, home carpet, tile, laminate. All you can think of, I do myself. I have my own major account with all dealers and everything. Yes.
Speaker A (01:32 - 01:40): Wow, that's great. So you provide us to residential, commercial, or mainly Residential? For now I do both.
Speaker B (01:40 - 02:06): I just, I just finished a restaurant in Washington, D.C. called the African Lounge and Cyber Lounge. Those are both commercial. And then I just finished a house in Berlin, Maryland, where we did all the wood flooring. And then there's another house here in Maryland close by that I just finished doing some wood flooring.
Speaker A (02:07 - 02:14): Wow. Well, making. Being busy, right? I mean, getting busy, huh? Making money.
Speaker B (02:14 - 02:16): Yes, slowly. Slowly getting busy.
Speaker A (02:17 - 02:26): Well, of course, that's the goal. You know, that's one of the problems most business owners would want to have. Now, do you have employees helping you out with that one or just doing it alone for themselves?
Speaker B (02:28 - 02:54): I take care of the paperwork and all the scheduling. And when I have time, either I send someone to come out and measure or if it's something that's a little bit larger in scale and needs a little more skill, I just come out myself and I. And I take care of the measurement with you or whoever the person in charge is and get more information just to make sure it's to your liking.
Speaker A (02:55 - 03:02): Right, right. I like that. You know, considering the. What customers would like and would need. Just want to confirm, though.
Speaker B (03:02 - 03:09): You're saying I have a car full of samples of all kinds of wood, carpet, ceramic.
Speaker A (03:10 - 03:22): Yeah, right. That's even amazing how these people can just choose, right, whatever they like based on their preference Now, I just want to confirm your sales. A zip code of 20705. Bread. Right.
Speaker B (03:23 - 03:27): 20705 and 20854.
Speaker A (03:28 - 03:32): Let's start with where you're based out of. What zip code is that?
Speaker B (03:32 - 03:34): Okay, I'm based out of 20705.
Speaker A (03:35 - 03:42): Thank you so much. Now, how many people do you have again, helping you out?
Speaker B (03:43 - 03:44): I have about 10.
Speaker A (03:45 - 03:48): Wow. Working full time or they're just on call?
Speaker B (03:51 - 03:55): Right now they're working full time. So when I don't have a job, they're going to be on call. But.
Speaker B (03:57 - 04:01): Luckily for me, things been okay. So I have been ongoing.
Speaker A (04:02 - 04:09): Well, I'm happy for you. So if I were to send you 20 leads in a month, Right. How many would you be able to close or to accommodate?
Speaker B (04:11 - 04:20): I would like to take on four to five leads a week or three to five leads a week. Wow.
Speaker B (04:22 - 05:01): I was like, maybe even less to start just to, just to get a feeling because a lot of advertising companies are, are, are blowing my phone apart. Like, get on this, get on that. And. And I kind of fell for the trap at first. Then they just don't stop calling me. And I tried a couple of them and it's like they just want the money. They don't really do too much. So if I can get something that gives me real leads, real people and stuff like that, that's something that I would be interested in looking into.
Speaker A (05:01 - 06:01): Then this is what you deserve. This is what you're looking for. And you are the business owner that we're looking for. With the mindset and the, you know, the spirit that you have, this is perfect for you. So our company, Fred, we monitor the traffic of search terms online. And the main reason that we called, because we've been seeing an increase in demand and the number of people searching for your type of service, Fred, you won't believe it, but just for the past 30 days in the area just for flooring, there's about 1074 number of searches from people looking for your type of service. Oh, wow. Right. That's just for the past 30 days, Fred. They just can't find you yet. That's why they cannot reach you. So if I could put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested, already looking for the service, for sure that will be very beneficial for the company.
Speaker A (06:03 - 06:04): Right, Fred?
Speaker B (06:04 - 06:12): If I could make, if I can make one sale a week, that would cover my profit.
Speaker B (06:14 - 06:23): And my profit costs and my advertising costs. So if I can make two sales a week, I would be happy Right.
Speaker A (06:23 - 07:34): I love that. This is really perfect for you. Imagine even a single job, Fred, to tell you honestly, even a single job is already way more than the cost of the service we have here for you. So let me tell you about a few real quick and how exactly this works. So again, our company, Fred, is 4Women Locals, one of the largest SEO companies in the country. We're one of the handful of certified Google partners worldwide. We've been doing this for 18 years now and we've already helped over 70,000 customers in Cali. They've stayed with us year in and year out. It's not because they have to, but because they're making money and they're happy with what they're getting. So what we're going to do, we build you a complete online presence spread that covers any way new customers would look for you online. So just imagine this. Anytime new customers would go online, when they go to Google, they search for a reliable flooring constructor in the area. We make sure, Fred, that they see your business name, your phone number and your website front and center above your competition.
Speaker A (07:36 - 07:45): So what do you think will happen? What do you think will happen, Fred, if it's your name and your phone number customers will always find whenever they need a service?
Speaker B (07:49 - 07:50): Yes.
Speaker A (07:52 - 07:59): For sure. I mean that will give them the opportunity, Fred, to call you the reppy. And that means more business for you, right?
Speaker B (08:00 - 08:04): You're with 411 locals. Uh huh.
Speaker A (08:04 - 08:11): Fred, you got it right. 411 local. That's the name of our company. So how we do this for you?
Speaker B (08:11 - 08:17): I don't know if you had me on file before, but I had a very big problem with 411 local.
Speaker A (08:17 - 08:23): Oh, what happened Fred? Let me check. What happened? Let me double check.
Speaker B (08:23 - 09:32): So you've been with us before and they. I signed up a long time ago. I paid a good amount of money several times and they still didn't publish my website. The Google kept on coming back saying, you need to fix this, you need to fix this. So I would send it to 41 locals and they would reformat it. And it was, I don't know what they did, but it just kept on popping up. So it never showed up. But I kept on paying every month. And then I, I got very upset with them and I said cancel my service and they would not cancel my service. They kept on charging me. I had to cut my credit card and cancel that credit card. So they won't, they would stop charging me because they would not, as much as I told them, stop charging my Card. I want out. They never listened to me. They never paid no attention to me or, or anything. It's like I was just ignored and I felt really bad. And I don't think I want to do business with 41 locals.

Speaker A (09:59 - 10:00): Hold on, let me double check.
Speaker A (10:02 - 10:04): Give me a sec. Fred.
Speaker A (10:06 - 10:09): 320-1789-6393, correct?
Speaker B (10:11 - 10:14): Yes. 301-789-6393.

Speaker A (10:30 - 10:32): Hold on, give me a sec. Fred.
Speaker A (10:33 - 11:13): Because that's weird. We don't actually. We always make sure. I mean of course nobody's perfect. Fred. Right. But would that extent. Oh, of course we don't do that with that extent that you've mentioned because we always make sure, I mean for the 18 years that we've been doing this spread, we only make sure that, I mean it's going to be easier for clients especially with the verification process. Well, of course we can't always expect for it to be perfect because sometimes there are Google certification and Google process that we can't avoid that we fail. But that's with what you've just said, Fred. I'm not sure that really happened because we always make sure that it's going to be convenient for our customers part.
Speaker B (11:14 - 11:17): Especially with a very certified Google partner.
Speaker A (11:18 - 11:22): Yes, Fred, we are. Let me send you our website or let me send you our certification with.

Speaker B (52:53 - 52:53): One second.
Speaker A (53:08 - 54:16): Now while you're checking, while you're checking everything here. So I'm just going to make sure everything is correct in here, especially with the all information. So when you sign up for ICO Services, remember that senior business on the first page of Google. At the beginning, we do a lot of work like building a website and making sure Google knows about you. So this is so important and you want to build your business right away. This slow start is normally expected. It's really important to trust the process and be patient during the first three months. The income that is putting the groundwork in place. After the setup period, things start to pick up. You'll begin to see your business show up more often when people search for it not just near you, but in bigger areas, too. By sticking through the whole process, you give your business the best chance to get noticed more and attract more customers. This is the key to getting lasting results that keeps getting better. And also I want to let you know that it's very important that your customers leave a good review of the works you've done, so other people can see it. If we can get at least 12 customers to leave you a review on your listing within the first three months, this will help your position, owning and the optimization itself. Okay.
Speaker B (54:17 - 54:19): Okay, perfect.
Speaker A (54:19 - 54:26): Now let me just quickly confirm everything just to make sure I got everything correctly. So again, I'm speaking with the business owner, Fred Nasretti, correct?
Speaker B (54:27 - 54:28): Yes.
Speaker A (54:28 - 54:44): And this is. Yeah, since this. I'll say it's the same company name and address registered, Right. A s service out. Great. And the address we'll be using is 8520 Fox Run, Potomac, Maryland 20854, correct?
Speaker B (54:45 - 54:45): Yes.

Speaker B (54:53 - 54:54): That's right.
Speaker A (54:55 - 55:00): And the alternate number is going to be 301-789-6393, correct?
Speaker B (55:01 - 55:02): Yes.
Speaker A (55:02 - 55:35): Great. Let me confirm the email. That's fredlosariservicebc.com that's F for Foxtrot, R for Romeo, E for Echo, D for Delta, and then All Star service. DC A for Alpha, L for Lima, L for Lima, S for Sam, T for Tango, A for Alpha, R for Romeo, S for Sam, E for Echo, R for Romeo, V for Victor, I for India, C for Charlie, A for at COD, D for Delta, C for Charlie dot com. Fred. @AllStarServiceBC.com correct?
Speaker B (55:36 - 55:36): Yes.
Speaker A (55:37 - 55:41): Perfect. Now, you're the owner authorized to make decision.
Speaker B (55:41 - 55:41): Hold on.
Speaker A (55:41 - 56:07): You're the owner authorized to make decisions for the business. A s dot. Service, llc. Flooring. That's capital A. Period, capital S. Period, capital S. And then E, R, V, I, C. I'm sorry? E, R, V, I, C, E. Capital L. Capital L, Capital C. And then open and close parenthesis. Flooring. F, L, O, O, R, I, N, G. Correct.
Speaker A (56:09 - 56:17): Crates. Thank you so much. So we will be using your business line and your phone number for all marketing materials, correct?
Speaker B (56:18 - 56:19): Yes.
Speaker A (56:19 - 56:25): Great. And you understand that anytime you want to change your phone number, your placement on the first page will drop, correct?
Speaker B (56:27 - 56:27): Yes.
Speaker A (56:28 - 56:50): Perfect. So normally the price for this is $700, but we are giving you a very, very big discount. Your car, we charge $49.99. None of them both. Set a fee today to activate your service and your call will be audible. $202.99 every month. Your charge will be on the 10th of January and thereafter for services rendered for the previous month. This is postpaid service. Okay.
Speaker B (56:52 - 56:53): Okay, perfect.
Speaker A (56:54 - 58:03): So this is how it's going to work. First three months, we build everything that Google requires. The website, the listing, the links, and everything. Then Google starts to promote you on the search engine. And you start to show up in your zip code after the first month. Month, as you're building momentum, you start to get reviews. And we do all the things that make Google trust you. Then after the second or third month, you really start to get momentum. You really started that momentum. Google trust you more and more. Finally, you branch out from neighborhood to your city. We'll send you the links to the listing as you start to appear in your zip code. And each part of the process as we build them so you can see the progress. Remember, this is placement. And placement is what you need to be successful, successful in Google. And obviously Google is the best place to be. And I want to make sure that you understand this is online advertising. Every industry has different results and no company can guarantee result like leads or calls. And those six months. And again, I want to repeat, Fred, this is very important. Your customers leave a good review of the works you've done so other people can see it. If we can get 12 customers to leave you a review on your listing within the first three months, this will help you position online and the optimization itself. Okay.
Speaker B (58:05 - 58:07): Can you transfer my Google reviews?
Speaker A (58:09 - 58:48): What do you mean? Well, no worries. Okay, good question. Good thing you brought that up since you already have a Google profile. So we're going to manage the listing for you and optimize it on the first page, so no need of transferring. Okay, you authorize us to do that. Right thank you so much. Thank you for confirming everything. Any question you have, any concern you have Fred don't hesitate to reach us. This is just the kickoff of advertising campaign it will lead to something bigger. Thank you so much for vote of confidence. Welcome again to the 401 locals now Fred please keep your line open your onboarding team will be contacting you within 24 to 48 hours.

I was kind of just, yeah, open to, uh, open-minded to a lot of jobs like that, you know, kind of, uh, I don't have any big equipment yet, so. All right. You're just getting started there? How long you've been doing this for? As a business? Uh, just a few weeks, you know. I've I've always kind of, uh, done the lawns and stuff, you know, between, uh, just either helping out or actually being with, uh, I worked on a golf course for a while, so I did a lot of that stuff for them. Golf course? And, uh, so, yeah, just starting to dive in and, uh, yeah, hopefully trying to grow this business, you know, so. 100%. Congratulations for starting a new business then. Uh, so it's like a full-time thing already? You're like, so like, it's not part-time. It's you're 100% into it now? Not, uh, not 100%. Honestly, it's, uh, I don't have enough clients to consider myself full-time. So, uh, yeah, that's that's where I'm trying to get. That's for sure. Some customers to go 100%. Okay. So you're still working at the golf course still or are you the full-time job is just like in the morning for your schedule? No, no. I was at the golf course. That was probably, uh, at least a year ago and, uh, I've been I'm just driving Uber Eats and, uh, DoorDash lately, you know.

I think you guys do good there, so it's pretty cool. All right. And plus, um, It's not too bad sometimes. Yeah, like it's kind of like, uh, schedule you can have on it. You can pause anytime.

Cool. That's very smart, by the way. I think that's a smart movie there. It's pretty cool. All right. And, um, so you're doing advertising right now? What kind of ads are you running? Are you a Facebook, Craigslist, Yop, Nextdoor, Better Business Real? Are you biting leaves or something? Uh, what kind of apps are you working with at the moment? At the moment, I've only just posted my first ads on Craigslist and, uh, Nice. I'm starting to put together my Facebook page, so, uh, yeah, I'm I'm starting to get a few followers and likes on that. I've done the advertising with the actual company yet. I know you can pay them to advertise. I haven't gotten that far with Facebook, but, uh, It's a lot through Meta, right? I was hoping to get there, you know, once I get some followers. What was that? Yes. Yeah, Meta, right? Like it should be good because Meta kind of like, it's not like Google, but it's still good because it works like algorithm. So it does it does get your traction there too, I think. And it's just kind of cheap. So that's a good option you should try. Facebook Meta ads. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah, no, possibly. Possibly. Okay. So, um, what we do here, I don't know if you heard of the term called SEO, though. I don't know if that rings the bell to you. The SEO or sponsor ads on Google. Have you heard of that before? Um, yeah, no, I I've kind of been looking into some of that, you know. I I don't even have a business, uh, I I'm not set up on Google yet, but, uh, Mhm. Yeah, I was kind of taking it step by step with a lot of the platforms for sure. Yeah, because, um, I know, I mean, you're busy, right? Um, you have jobs, it's kind of hard to keep up, right, with all this, I know. It's time-consuming, right? But I know, um, Okay. Do you, you know how SEO works?

Well, my name is Michael, I'm reaching out with 41 Locals. Uh, we're a marketing agency. And we're reaching out because we're looking for reliable business in your area to work with. Uh, I want to ask you guys a few quick questions if you guys be a good fit. Because we're a marketing agency and we're offering a marketing service because there's been an increase of people looking for those type of window cleaning services in your area. So, I said you have here been doing window cleaning services here in Everett, correct? That's correct. All right. And what's your current zip code you have here at the moment? 98203. 98203 and how far would you say you guys can travel from that zip code to take on new customers? Of course, depending on like on the job, right? Would uh, how far would you say you guys can normally travel? Uh, I guess depending on the job, but we can go into the greater Seattle area. That's you know, that's fine. Okay, so you can travel, but it just depends on the job. Perfect. And what are you guys currently doing to generate like like new customers at the moment? Is it just like uh, word of mouth, recommendations, website, social media? Recommendations, uh, all the above. But right now it's mainly just word of mouth and business cards and just uh, going off of our work, you know. And uh, people appreciating the quality that we do. Oh, well that's definitely a good thing. I mean good work definitely speaks for itself. Well, the reason we're actually reaching out is is for that reason is because we're with 41 Locals. We're a marketing service. And when we did do a quick search for you guys just for that general area, I mean there has been a increase of people looking for those type of services in that area. And your business is not there, so you guys don't have like that complete online visibility for people to find and look for you guys online. So, what our company does is we're going to just create you guys like that complete online presence, but we put you in front of all those interested customers looking for your type of services by promoting you on over 100 online directories. Including the first page of like Google, Yelp, Bing, Angie's, Mantis, Merchant Circle, Yahoo, and many others. Uh, with keywords. So, rather somebody knows your company name or not, as long as they're looking for your type of service, your type of industry in your area. We'll we make sure you guys always come out front and center above all your competition, right? And it will make a big difference because the majority of people are going to buy something nowadays, do it online. Or rather be like food, clothing, services, pretty much everything and they use Google all the time. And even though there is a lot of companies are doing those type of services, there's not a lot that have like that online visibility. A lot of people are just still just doing like Facebook, Instagram, social media, which is a good thing, but unless somebody actually knows like your company name, your personal name, it's really hard for them to find you instead of all the ones that actually are. Now, me personally, I'm a I'm a visual type person. I like to see things visually. So, in the short time while I was actually talking to you, I went ahead and created you a quick example website for your business. Just to give you an idea of how we created that online visibility. I just sent it to you right now via text message. All right. Now, uh, take the text message that is. I sent you a link. It should say 41locals.com, which is our company name, then your phone number. Uh, just click on the link and you should open up that that example website I created for you. It's just a quick example. So, that doesn't mean it's going to stay like that, but I put your company name, your phone number, your area, and corporate modern pictures, which you're going to be able to personalize that however you like. Just just a quick example. I don't know if I don't know if you're able to see it. Yeah, I'm able to see it. I'm looking at it right now. Oh, okay. Perfect. Yeah, that's just a quick example of what like the manager, it's going to come with 7iT. So, if you're going to be able to incorporate your own pictures, colors, logos, whatever you like. But while you are looking at that, to tell you guys a little bit more about us. Um, our company is called 41 Locals. So, I sent you another text message with all of our company information, my name, links, testimonials, reviews, videos, certifications. Pretty much everything we've done as well. But like I mentioned, to tell you guys a little bit more about us. Our company's called 411 Locals. So, we're one of the largest SEO companies in the country and one of a handful of Google certified partners worldwide. Right. So, I mean we have a four star rating on Google itself. And we've actually helped over 70,000 customers and counting. They've actually stayed with us because they're actually getting results. So, I mean we do all the marketing so you guys don't have to worry about it. And the way we actually do this is very simple. We assigned you guys to a team of 7iT professionals who are going to build you that complete online presence. And I mean these guys have bachelors and master's degrees and have past Google status. So, we're going to put you on not only the first page placement of Google under five of the service you provide, but over 100 online directories as well. Like first page of Google, Yelp, Bing, Angie's, Mantis, Merchant Circle, Yahoo, and many others with keywords. Right? So, rather somebody knows your company name or not, as long as they're looking for your type of service, your type of industry in your area. Okay. We make sure we make sure you you yeah, we make sure you guys always come out front and center above all your competition. So, no matter where they look for you guys online, as long as they look for your type of service or industry, we make sure you guys come out front and center. Nice. Right, have it? Yeah, I mean it will make a big difference when it comes to getting like more visibility because most people don't go past the first page. And as uh yeah. Yeah, I mean as a business owner, I mean I'm sure you definitely see the value of getting reviews from your customers, correct? Absolutely. Yeah, that's what definitely makes uh a big difference because of course, once you do a great job and someone puts a review and they're like, ""Excellent company, highly recommended,"" or something of that nature. Yeah. When when someone else visits your website, they're going to be able to see that, right? And that's like instant credibility. Because honestly, I mean nobody wants to be the first person like to try something new. So, once someone else has done it, they've seen it, they're just a lot more trust and they're more likely to reach out. Right? But but aside everything that we're Yeah, but besides everything we're giving you guys right now, besides the website, the online directories, the the i the IT and the and the virtual assistant, um um besides all that, uh everything that we're offering right now, we have it on a promotional price right now in your area. Uh, but uh, that we're actually giving you guys additional services as well that's called 41 Connect. So, what that service does is like a virtual assistant that's going to filter all those calls for you. So, how are we going to create you guys like that online visibility, put you in front of all those interested customers online? Will you realize you're going to receive a lot more phone calls, right? Of course, because you're on the internet. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I mean yeah, I mean and of course, I'm not saying that all those phone calls are going to be just the customers. Of course not, you're also going to receive telemarketers, advertising sales calls. I mean pretty much everything because you're on the internet. So, what that service does is like a virtual assistant that's going to filter all those calls for you. Yeah. So, for example, if you receive a phone call from someone that has absolutely nothing to do with your business, not even a question or concern, they'll actually filter out all those calls for you, so you won't have to go to your phone. You won't you won't even have to read. And if it's a real customer, even if it's just a question or concern, but has something to do with your business, they'll actually pass those over to you live where you can attend it. And if you're not available like to take the call at the moment, they'll actually get all the clients information and send that over to you so you give them a call back whenever you're available. That's an additional free service that we're offering just for you can focus on the job at hand and not have to worry about like answering phone calls every 5 seconds seeing if it's a real customer or not. Right? Gotcha. Yeah, and I mean and honestly, I mean the well the service is meant to pay for itself. I mean just to give you an example. Just here in the last 30 days, I mean just for a window cleaning itself in that area, there's been over 1,236 recent searches about like 1,200 customers looking for those services. Okay. And now of course, I'm not saying that all 1,200 are going to call you or hire you. Well of course not, right? But they're all going to be able to see you. Right. Because whether they do you guys or not, with the keywords, you're always going to come out on the first page, no matter where they look for you guys, whether they know you guys or not. So, they're all going to be able to see you. So, instead of those 1,200 calls, let's say only small example. Let's say only 5% call you, right? 5% is a very small example. But just an example, but 5% of 1,200 is still around like uh, like 60 calls. Now out of those 60 calls, of course, you still have to make an agreement with them. Because it's not about you loaning your cost or like giving out your service for free. Because your time is money. So, let's say out of those um, uh, so let's say out of those 60 calls, let's say you only close, let's say 50%, which is half, which which is around like 30 customers. Now, in one month time period, how many of those 30 customers do you think you guys can skip? And I know it depends on like on the job and the project, but Yeah. I I understand what you mean. Yeah, okay. Yeah, well you can see what you guys could be potentially making. Mhm. Right. Definitely. Okay. Yeah, I mean and and um I mean uh would that be something you guys would be interested in for your business or Yeah, I I feel like this service will be something I'd be interested in. Would it be possible that I could reach you back at one of these numbers that you uh gave me before I I need some time to think about this one? Yeah, we we could always give you guys a call back. I mean that's not a problem. But one thing I do let you know like I had mentioned to you in the beginning, uh right now we have a promotion right now going out. So, just like we're reaching out to you guys, we're reaching out to other companies because there's that increase. So, right now everything that we're actually offering you guys, I mean the website, the online directories, the IT's, keywords, digital business cards as well, everything that we're offering right now, we only have we have it on a promotion it's only $49.96. Only $50 set up fee, no commitments, no obligations, 50 bucks everything comes included for you can see what we have to offer. Now, after 30 days, then everything goes month to month. After 30 days, the normal month the rate is only $202.96. That's auto builder currency postpaid services. So, if they don't ask for that right now, right now it's only 50 bucks set up fee to get you started. After 30 days, it's the the promotional price is only $202.96 a month. Uh, and that's a flat rate. That's something you guys need to know like that. Okay. Well, I appreciate I appreciate your services and your time. Um, I will call you back when I want to talk about it with my other co-founder and um, yeah. Uh, that sounds good, but um, I I have to think about it. But thank you very much.

Speaker A (00:43 - 00:56): Well, right now it's just a local service. I just started marketing myself a few months ago and taking on jobs and stuff. But it really just depends. I mean, I'm open to opportunities.
Speaker B (00:57 - 01:00): That's very good. So is it a new business?
Speaker A (01:00 - 01:14): Yeah, I'm not even licensed yet. I'm working on getting licensed this month. Licensures and all of that. I have a business license for my real estate investing business, but I need to get a contractor's license.
Speaker B (01:16 - 01:34): So you are not yet a licensed contractor for handyman work. Right, Right. That's good. Not a problem with that. So I thought you have mentioned this is a new business or how long have you been running in this business so far?
Speaker A (01:35 - 01:37): About three months or so.
Speaker B (01:37 - 01:43): Oh, wow. So this is a pretty new company, right?
Speaker A (01:44 - 01:44): Right.
Speaker B (01:44 - 01:49): But you're working before from a different company or this is the first business that you have?
Speaker A (01:50 - 01:51): Yeah, I was working for a different company.
Speaker B (01:53 - 02:03): Okay, so you got a lot of experience working from a different company, doing handyman job, and then you just have to open a new business, right?
Speaker A (02:03 - 02:11): Something like that, yeah. I mean, I was working with building management Systems before for 12 years before opening up my own handyman work.
Speaker B (02:13 - 02:28): While that speaks for the quality service that is the provider. So as what you mentioned, as of the moment, you are doing local services only. But of course you're willing to travel in the future. As long as the pace is good, right?
Speaker A (02:28 - 02:33): It depends, you know, it depends on what's out there and.
Speaker A (02:34 - 02:35): What the opportunity is.
Speaker B (02:36 - 02:49): Okay, that's very nice. Well, Mace, you know what I got here? My manager, the one asked me to give you a call. His name is Ismael. Ismael. I have heard, Nate. He's the owner of the business for three months and can still handle his customers.
Speaker A (02:49 - 02:50): Okay.
Speaker B (02:50 - 02:51): How you doing today?
Speaker A (02:51 - 02:54): Good. I'm just wondering what you guys are calling.

Speaker B (00:02 - 00:09): It depends, you know, it depends on what's out there and what the opportunity is.
Speaker A (00:10 - 00:23): Okay, that's really nice. Well, Nate, you know what? Exactly. My manager, the one who asked me to give you a call, his name is Ismael. Ismael. I have here Nate. He's the owner of the business for three months and can still handle new customers.
Speaker C (00:23 - 00:25): Okay. Who are you today?
Speaker B (00:25 - 00:29): Good. I'm just wondering what you guys are calling about.
Speaker C (00:29 - 01:08): Okay, no worries, Nate. Also, that's the reason that I'm with you. So let me introduce myself again, and I'm glad to know that you are doing good. So my name is Ismael. I'm managing my company that is 411 local. The reason that I asked my assistant. He can take me with you, Nate, is because, well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does hand demand service on this area because, well, there's a great increase in the demand of customers that are looking for this. So what I would like to do is to see the way that we can just work together and put you in front of all of these customers that are looking for this service. And imagine if we have more than a thousand customers looking for this month by month, and you can be there for all of these people, that will be as much beneficial, right?
Speaker B (01:08 - 01:16): Yeah. I mean, I'm not really looking to spend a whole lot. Spend any money on this right at the moment. I just started doing inside work recently.
Speaker C (01:16 - 01:25): And what's the reason that you are and thinking that, hey, you only spend money on this or that you are not able to make it?
Speaker B (01:26 - 01:38): Well, I mean, I would assume that you guys. It sounds like you guys are like a marketing company or you want to put, you know, want me to probably spend money on the website or marketing and all that kind of stuff to get in front of customers is what it kind of sounds like.
Speaker C (01:38 - 01:41): But you're not looking to get more customers in now?
Speaker B (01:41 - 01:58): I mean, I'm getting customers right now, and I have a few customers that are keeping me going, but I'm not looking for services right now. I don't. You know, right now I'm just trying to keep my head about water. So I can't really, you know, put money into a website and, you know, marketing and all of that.
Speaker C (01:58 - 02:07): So if I can tell you on this way, right, Nate, that the only thing that I'm about to ask you is $49.99, that would be too much for you.
Speaker B (02:07 - 02:11): Well, I mean, it really just depends on what you guys are offering, I.
Speaker C (02:11 - 02:17): Guess, yeah, if you let me tell you, maybe you can see that this will be of course create a thing for you. Okay.
Speaker B (02:17 - 02:18): If you.
Speaker C (02:18 - 04:21): So let me tell them this way, then what we would like to do is to see the way that this will be on the best way and benefits for your business so that you don't need to do also any additional work than the service that you're. And then we will be in charge of the presence, the optimization, the maximum exposure and everything for your business on the way that you will be only in charge of picking up your phone, making the jobs, getting the payment from the customers and doing the things that I know that you can do the best that is to bring your customers a quality service and to make your customers happy. I know that this is something that, that you can easily do right now. So then on this way we will not ask you anytime. We never ask you for commissions percentage any month per lead, pre job, for projects or first call. Because we want you to get as much jobs as possible. That of course help you to succeed and grow. Because well, if you are growing, we will grow directly with you on a long term relationship. Because on that way, as I told you, we are a performance based company. And then we want to show you where everything that you are getting, what we are creating and the benefits that this is giving you so that you can be happy with the service with us. And of course we can be working as much time as we. Right. And then on that way, so that you are making the money that you are looking for, that you can have your business in the way that you want it, with the customers that you are looking for and of course with the income that you are looking to get. And then in that way that this will be always based on the facts and the numbers. Let me tell you, our service is a postpaid service. That means that you will be only paying for the service rendered to you, but on the month before. So for an example, reactivate the service today, your first monthly payment, it will be until January 10th. So that will be the first time that I will be asking you for a monthly payment on that service day. And then of course we will be working together with you to show you the progress and that you will be looking at directly by yourself. So of course that you can be happy with the service and we can as long as possible. Now looking for the service now that you do. The handyman, tell me about the services that you provide. What are the ones that you think that Are like the ones that you do the most? I don't know, painting, flooring, bathrooms, kitchen remodeling, tile roofing. What are the ones that you do the most guys?
Speaker B (04:21 - 04:43): I do really a little bit of everything. I mean mostly I've been working with rent and I don't have a lot of time on the phone here, but I work with like rent ready properties. So I did some painting today. Doorknobs, blinds, a couple of things of that nature. And then there's other times where I'm doing like.
Speaker B (04:45 - 04:59): Working on houses that have like a punch list of items need to be done in order for somebody to sell their property. So it could be toilet, you know, getting toilets working or something of that nature. And most of it's pretty small. Small stuff.
Speaker C (04:59 - 04:59): Yeah.
Speaker B (05:00 - 05:02): Yard cleanup and other things of that nature.
Speaker C (05:02 - 05:20): Oh, okay, okay, okay. So is it modeling like everything that goes like remodeling or fixing issues on the house so then maybe like for property manager, they are going to rent it or sell it so that you can leave the place on the best conditions so that they can make it right? Yeah.
Speaker B (05:21 - 05:25): Fixing items in the house that typically need to get done.
Speaker C (05:26 - 05:40): Yeah. You know, sometimes when they rent it and maybe the door is a little bit low or you need to put it on the right place so that for the things and everything. Yeah, I understand. Or some, maybe the walls not made it a little bit of kind of thing and then you make.
Speaker B (05:42 - 05:44): Holes in walls and other things like that.
Speaker C (05:44 - 06:09): Yeah, sometimes, you know, people exchanging the nailing with the mirrors or something. So you need to just fix that on the walls. Huh? Okay, that's good. And then on this way, so for the service that you've been doing this time, the way that you manage that, customers will be able to find you or prospects will be able to get to you, how you do it by the recommendations, the word smile, your business card, your flyers, your website, how good they are that way.
Speaker B (06:09 - 06:27): I'm just on Craigslist right now. A lot of inseminity customers, so I'll get new clients. And a lot of it tends to end up being, you know, some of it's commercial and some of it's like maintenance companies. And then they'll call me and whenever I end up doing work for them, they always call me back because I do a good job.
Speaker C (06:27 - 06:36): Oh, okay. Okay. But mostly then the one that you think that works the best for you is the word mouth recommendations or what one is the one that you think that is.
Speaker B (06:38 - 06:54): It's probably just repeat a lot of the Clients that I end up getting on Craigslist are people that have more than a single job. They'll have multiple jobs over a period of time. They're like maintenance, and they'll just continue to do maintenance contracts with people and then they'll call me to do the work.
Speaker C (06:55 - 08:02): Okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Now let me tell you then on this way, so what we will be doing on this is that you will be having a constant flow of work and of course, a job and then on this way, so that they will tell you to succeed and grow. And then for sure, as I mentioned, that we will make it on the best way. And it's just for you that for less than what a single job can bring, you will be on that way for the service. So that it will be working on the best way possible for you. Because just for an example, as we said, maybe I bring you some clients that I want you to do a painting job on two bedrooms on their house. So there will be 12x12. The good thing about this is, as you said, not that there are no furniture in there. And also there are not so much things to do about the walls, just the painting. And it will ask you just to paint the walls. We are not going to do nothing about the ceiling, just the walls, and both rooms will be on the same color. If I can drive you. Sorry, if I can drive you 10 or 15 customers, like on that kind of service, of course, on your local area, how many of that jobs do you think that you can be able to perform on two weeks? For example? It can drive you 10 or 15. How many of them you can be able to do?
Speaker B (08:04 - 08:07): Probably 10 or so.
Speaker C (08:07 - 08:27): Maybe 10. Yeah. Okay. And then you won't let me lie because I've been working before on that. So a service like the one that we said, depending on the quality of the paint, it can be going from 1,000 to $1,200. So if you can be able to do 10 on two weeks so that it would be $10,000, that it would be very beneficial for your business. Right?
Speaker B (08:27 - 08:27): Sure.
Speaker C (08:27 - 09:21): And then. So in two weeks you are doing that. If we go to the month, it will be 20 so that it will be double of this amount. Right. So Anuja, do you think I can tell you right there so that on this service, the way that we want to do it is that this will be with the constant flow of customers and jobs and the income that you're getting, of course, that we want this to be paying directly by yourself because, well, just to Let you know on that rate directly. So for the area that you are, the monthly rate that we have on the service, that it will be working for your business. So on the way that this is of the best benefit for you. But if I can tell you that we are having a rate that is worth $243.99 a month. But imagine from the first job that you've been doing, you have more than covered the full month of service with me. And also from the first job you have gaining like 75%. And then all the other jobs that you've been doing on the month, it will be completely gaining for you. Right.
Speaker B (09:23 - 09:29): How are you getting customers though? Do you guys get customers and then you outsource them to me or how does that work?
Speaker C (09:30 - 10:09): No, also it's better than that, completely better. So the customer will be calling you directly and then they will tell you the service, they will give you the address for sure and on that way they will let you know when you can go to check the place. So then you will go, you will give them the estimate. And then because these people have the need, they want the service, they have a budget and the thing that they're looking is for someone that is a trustworthy person that brings the quality service the only thing that they're wearing so that you can tell them how much you will be charging and when you can do the job. So then you will be in charge of setting the appointment with the customers, of giving the price, depending on the service conditions and then getting the payment directly.
Speaker B (10:09 - 10:13): And then I guess my question is how are you driving traffic?
Speaker C (10:16 - 11:16): All the strategic and great places on the way that when all of these customers are looking for the services that you provide, the option that they always find for services and your business. Just to let you know, I will mention you one of the things that we do. We are going to put you on more than 50 online directives like mentioned, Craiglist Yellow Pages, Prepages, Jelp, Bing, Manta, Yahoo and too much more. Because right now we have like 70 online directives. We are going to put you on the Google my business the listing, the organic listing on the first placement directly on Google and with my equipment of the seven professionals over there, it they will be looking on your area and on your market to send this drive these customers directly only to you and to your views. And then on this way that you know if you are on all the native places for these areas to be. So we have in this way more than 2,500 customers looking one by one for this service so that you can do as much as possible. That will be for you guys. And then on this way it will be.
Speaker B (11:17 - 11:28): Yeah, I'm currently not interested right now. I'm surprised. I'm working on a few things that I'm not going to really be able to do a lot of work. Right now.
Speaker C (11:30 - 11:38): You are booked up. So what's that? For how much time you are like, booked up that you are not able to do? For how much time?
Speaker B (11:38 - 11:41): How often am I booked up where I'm not able to do jobs?
Speaker B (11:44 - 12:14): It's not about that. It's actually about me working on my house so I can sell it. I just have a mountain of things to do that I need to get done in order to sell my house so I can close on it. And that's taking up a lot of my time. And then I have to decide whether or not I want to continue to pursue doing handyman work as more than just a side business. If I do, then I want to get licenses on it before I start really pushing my name out there.
Speaker C (12:14 - 12:16): Right now they don't even have insurance.
Speaker B (12:16 - 12:17): They don't have anything.
Speaker C (12:17 - 12:30): Right. And also the insurance or the license, it will be needed with money. Right. You need to pay to have it. And the thing that will give you the money to make it, it will be if you are doing some jobs. Right, Understood.
Speaker B (12:30 - 12:42): And I'm getting jobs. You know, it's not like I don't have work. I've got. I'm booked out about a few weeks right now between jobs that I currently already have in the books and then the work that I need to be.
Speaker C (12:42 - 12:52): Doing on my own. Okay, so then you're not able to get more customers. That's what you're saying. In the beginning you tell me that you're looking for customers, but now you say that you're just. No.
Speaker B (12:53 - 12:54): At some point.

Speaker C (02:19 - 02:20): Yes, I am.
Speaker B (02:20 - 02:48): Right, well, here's the thing, James. The reason why I did call you right now is because our company is the one who closely monitors the online traffic search of people looking and searching for your services right now. Specifically in your city. Right. And in Fact in the past, for today's change, there is already a total of 713 total monthly search coming from the population looking and searching for your services right now.
Speaker A (02:48 - 02:50): So if I could put your business.
Speaker B (02:50 - 03:14): In front of those interested people searching and looking for your services, that would be something very, very beneficial. Right, Jane? Right. Now, here's what we do, Jane. When people search online for junk removal services in Lakewood City in Washington, they usually don't type in a business name. Right? They just search for the service of what they're looking for.
Speaker C (03:14 - 03:15): Correct.
Speaker B (03:15 - 03:42): Like junk removal means or the best junk removal service in liquid. And if you're not showing up, your competitors are getting those phones. Right? And that is the reason why we're here. Because we want to make sure that at any time of day, if someone is looking and searching for your services, they would be able to find you front and center your competition.

Speaker B (03:57 - 03:59): Do you know them personally or no?
Speaker C (03:59 - 03:59): No.
Speaker B (04:00 - 04:05): How about Joe's Junk Removal and Demolition Elves? Does it ring a bell?
Speaker C (04:06 - 04:08): No, not really. I haven't looked at my competition.
Speaker B (04:10 - 04:40): Well, yeah, right. Well, I don't want you to mind them. Okay, but why this matters, it's because these are actually the ones who are now getting this big check out of those already interested customers. Well, it's not because they're better than you, but because they are likely the most visible in the eyes of Scott and your company or your business is not even there. You know, that's the tough part right now. Because even though you're the best option for junk removal in the area, but this.
Speaker C (04:41 - 04:43): I'm sorry, how do you know that?
Speaker B (04:43 - 04:45): Sorry, how do you. What do you.

Speaker A (04:47 - 04:49): Yeah, well, basically I know for sure.
Speaker B (04:49 - 05:19): You provide quality works. Right. So this customer should be also calling you as well. Correct. So that's the top part right now. Even though you are the best option for every customer, but if they can find you easily, they will just jump off and call other competition in your area. Right? And that is the reason why we're here. Because what we will do here at 411Locals is we want to make sure that your business shows up in front of those customers. So the calls and the jobs come to you instead of someone else.
Speaker C (05:19 - 05:20): How'd you find your number?
Speaker B (05:20 - 05:21): I'm sorry?
Speaker C (05:21 - 05:22): How do you find my number?
Speaker B (05:22 - 05:37): Well, basically speaking, we work with another umbrella of our company who find us those reliable people that can provide quality services that will be perfect fit with our program. And that's one of the reason why we're giving you a call right now. Okay.
Speaker B (05:41 - 05:42): Sorry.
Speaker C (05:43 - 05:48): No, I've missed the lead. Literally picking up your phone. I thought you guys were literally, like, a lead.

He just started uh this business, his own business uh with LLC, and currently he's using Facebook ad to get clients. Hello, Ice? I'm sorry, I was in the middle. Hello, Gonzalo, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Hi, happy Monday. How were you doing today? Good, how are you? Well, I'm doing fantastic. Thanks for asking. My name is Ice Bello, one of the area managers of 411 Locals. I did ask Ms. assistant to call you because we're looking for a reliable business in the area that we can work with. Now, I'm just going to ask a few quick questions to see if it's going to be a good fit for your company and our company to work together. So, Gonzalo, what kind of jobs do you usually take on? Uh, pressure washing and hauling. So, junk removal and outdoor work. Great. Residential and commercial, or mainly residential? Uh, whatever pops up. I'm open to any big job or small job. That's fantastic. I love that. But do you have a minimum charge for each job though, or it just really depends? It just depends on driving, how much manual labor, and it really just depends on the job. Right, right. And which areas are the most profitable or best for your jobs, Gonzalo? Tuscaloosa, Northport, or any areas in the in the nearby. Can I confirm your zip code, please? Repeat? Can I confirm your zip code, please? Uh, 35401. Thank you so much. Now, since you do pressure washing, you do junk removal hauling, which one is making you the most money so far, Gonzalo, if you don't mind me asking? Is it the pressure washing? Pressure washing. Oh, amazing. And Ms. assistant mentioned that you um, you're doing Facebook ads right now, right? That's where you're getting clients. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Yeah. So, I'm assuming you're paying for that one or it's just a Facebook page you you have? It's just a Facebook listing on marketplace. Ah, okay. And how many leads are you getting so far? Repeat? How many leads or customers are you getting so far from that Facebook uh listing you have? So far, I've gotten a few calls and a few jobs, but nothing too crazy so far, but hopefully it increases. That's right. That can be better. And that's You know what? I'm really glad Ms. assistant called you. This is just perfect for you, Gonzalo, because our company specializes in monitoring the traffic of search terms online. We called you because we've been seeing an increase in demand and the number of people that are searching for your type of service. In fact, just for the past 30 days in the area, there's about 836 number of searches from people that are looking for your type of service. They just can't find you yet, that's why they cannot reach you. Now, Gonzalo, if I can put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested and are already looking for the service, for sure that will be very beneficial for the company, right? Yes. Absolutely. Now, Gonzalo, have you ever heard about the company Moody's Pro Wash? Moody what? Moody Pro Wash. Have you heard about this company? Um, maybe. I know I've seen a lot of companies uh the last month because a lot of them will be competitors. Right, right. How about the company Great Brothers Hauling LLC? Sounds familiar? I think I think I have. Oh. Right, right. Well, to be honest, I don't know them at all. I'm just asking because these are the companies right now in the area that I'm seeing on the first page getting the phone calls. And I don't see your company name here yet, that's why we called you, because we want to put your name front and center above them. Because we want customers to be reaching you directly, especially today, over 80% of people are going online to look for what they need, even clothing, food, services, pretty much everything, and they use Google all the time. Now, you know what? You don't even have to worry this time about having your own website because we'll take care of that one for you. All you have to do is just answer the phone calls, provide them the service, and make them happy. We'll take care of all the logistics here. Okay. So, let me tell you about a few real quick and how exactly we can help. Again, our company is 411 Locals, one of the largest SEO companies in the country. We're one of the handful of certified Google partners worldwide. We've been doing this for 18 years now, and we've already helped over 70,000 customers and counting and they've stayed with us year in and year out. It's not because they have to, but because they're making money and they're happy with what they're getting. Now, what we're going to do, we'll build you a complete online presence that covers anyone new customers would look for you online. So, Gonzalo, imagine this. Anytime new customers would go online, when they go to Google, they search for a reliable junk removal company near me, or if they search for pressure washing service near me, we make sure that they see your business name, your phone number, and your website front and center above your competition. So, what do you think will happen, Gonzalo, if it's your company and your phone number that customers will always find on the first page whenever they need the service? What are you asking? Sorry. What do you think will happen if it's your company and your phone number that customers will always find on the first page whenever they need the service? It'd be a lot easier to have customers and have Exactly. Right. Because they're going to be able to call you directly, that means more chances of getting clients. So, how we do that, first is we put your company on the first page of Google under the services you provide and the services that make you the most money, and that's what we guarantee here. So, even if customers don't know you, even if they don't know your business name, but whenever they search and they type in the services or the keywords, your company automatically pops up, and they will call you naturally because they're going to see you're the best. Now, as a business owner, pretty much you see the value of getting reviews from your customers, right? Yes, ma'am. Right. Because that's what we do best for you. We're going to make it easier for all of your customers to be able to put reviews for you. So, these reviews are right there on the first page listings. Once someone puts your review on what a great or awesome job you did, then that's an instant credibility. Then customers will choose you over your competition. Now, since most of them use smartphones or tablets powered by Google, your company will be shown and center over Google Maps and Google Voice Search. Now, to show you how fast we do it, I can even show you a sample of a website for your business to show you how fast we do it. For sure, you have pictures of the work you've done so far, right? Uh, I just I just bought Or not. Ah, okay, no worries. Right. No worries, that's not going to be a problem. We can definitely help you out here. So, we're going to make sure here that you have your very own website that is fully optimized and designed to be on the first page where everyone can see. So, it's going to be a gorgeous website with all the information that you want your customer to see, and it's totally maintenance-free. So, whatever information that you want to add or you want to change, you just have to let us know. And of course, we're going to be transparent with you, so we're going to give you your own customer dashboard where you can see and monitor the progress every day. And through the customer dashboard, you're going to see there how many customers have called you, how many customers have reached your business through our campaign. By the way, did you get the sample website that I created for you, Gonzalo? Uh, where did you send it? I sent it to your text. You got it? Uh, no ma'am. Oh, I just got one. Perfect. You can take a look at it. That's just a sample, okay? That's not the final yet. Of course, you will be the boss here. So, however you want your website to look like, that's what we're going to build for you. If you want a specific color, specific picture, specific font, let us know. Okay? Now, on top of that, aside from creating your website, aside from putting on the first page of Google, now, since there's a small percentage of people that go to online directories like Yelp, Superpages, Manta, Merchant Circle, AngelList, we will also be listing your company in over 50 online directories and phone book listings so that no matter where customers search online, they're always going to find you. That way, they can contact you directly, they can pay directly, and you don't even have to pay each directory just to be listed in there because that's part of the package we have for you. So, this is a maximum online exposure and a complete online presence we have for your business. And Gonzalo, it's almost impossible not to make money out of this package because again, we're putting your company in front of the customers that are already interested and are already looking for the services. They just don't know who you are yet. Makes sense? Yes. Thank you. Now, out of the number of searches we're seeing here, I just want to ask you, Gonzalo, because I know it really depends, right, especially you can do pressure washing, you can do junk removal hauling, and you also will accept small to big jobs, but average-wise, how much do you make of an average job? Just average. Uh, for like a for like a drive, maybe 150 to 200. Great. Because out of the number of searches we're seeing here, if we could drive you 30 customers in a month, how many would you be able to close or to accommodate? In a month? Can can you repeat that? If we could drive you 30 leads or 30 customers in a month, how many would you be able to close or to accommodate? All of them. I'd be able to I love that. That's the spirit and the mindset of a business owner we're looking for. Now, let's just see say for example, for a $200 job and 30 customers, imagine that should already be $6,000 that you can make out of the exposure we have for you, right? Even a single job, Gonzalo, is already more than the cost of the service we have here for you. How much more if you get 30 or even more, right? And not just that. The good thing about this program because this will give you a constant flow of new customers calling you every time they need your service and they need something done. Now, that should be a great return of investment, right? Yes. Absolutely. You know what? I'm not even going to ask you $100, $200 up front because we want to earn your business first. We want to prove to you what we're capable of in terms of helping out your business. So, Gonzalo, today, I'm very more than willing to give this package to you for only $49.99, and we will start working for you right away. We're not going to be wasting time. So, that includes everything, the website, first page placement on Google, Google Maps and Google Voice Search, online directories and phone book listings. So, 49.99, that's the set up fee to get you started and we'll show you how exactly the program works. And now, Now, after a month, Gonzalo, on the 3rd of January, not 3rd of December, but 3rd of January, you see how the program works, you see the progress and the benefits, to maintain all the services and to maintain everything that we have for you, it will only be a flat rate. A flat rate of $243.99, audible recurring after 30 days. So, Gonzalo, even if you get 30 customers or more, even if you make $5,000, $10,000 or more, the price will never go up. It will never change. That's going to remain a flat rate. Okay. So, we're putting up a huge investment on this because that's how confident we are that this really works. And that's how confident we are that we can make you stay because for sure you're going to be happy with the progress. We want you to stay here because you're happy, not because you're forced to stay. So, we're going to work hard for you just to make sure that you're happy to stay. We're going to do all the marketing for you, so you won't have to. Because of course, that's the goal here, right? So, you're happy with the program, you're seeing the progress and the benefits for you to stay. We're not even going to ask any commission, any percentage in every customer you get or every money that you make, it's all yours. So, as long as you're happy, you're getting the right return of investment, then stay with us. We're going to make sure that you're stay with us. It's really worth it. Sounds fair? All right.

Hi, thank you.
Hi there, Hector.
How you doing, sir?
Good.
How are you?
Yes, sir.
I'm doing very well myself.
Thank you for asking.
My name is Darwin.
Uh, we're actually looking for an electrician who would like to work out there in the area.
And uh, yeah, I suppose your base out of Tacoma, right?
Yes, sir.
Okay, very good.
I'd like to ask just a couple questions first, though, if you don't mind.
I just want to see if this is going to be a good fit, okay?
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
All right.
Like, can you tell me, sir, how long you've been in business now?
The business, about less than a year.
Less than a year.
Okay, I can see you've been doing this 20 years now, though.
Is that right?
Yeah, say pals.
Yeah, so congratulations.
I guess you got tired of working hard, making somebody else rich.
Is that right?
Yes, yes sir.
All right, very good.
Are you the sole owner or like how many owners are there?
Right now just me.
Just you.
Okay, so you typically work alone for now or do you have some employees on the team?
Me and my wife.
It's you and your wife.
Uh, the employee is yes.
Yeah.
Okay, can you tell me about the type of jobs you usually take on, though?
All types, commercial residential.
Okay.
Restaurant, whatever.
Yeah.
Okay.
You do uh, installs, repair, right?
Service calls, all that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, everything.
Okay.
Now, and you are you doing this full time by the way or just on the side yet?
No, full time.
Yeah.
Full time.
Okay.
Now, um, let me ask you this there because I mean sorry, uh, Hector.
Um, because we both know there's a lot, uh, there's so many electricians out there and you just started.
A lot of people may haven't heard of you yet.
What have you been doing so far to find customers to keep yourself busy?
I just uh, repeat customers, referrals.
Mhm.
Okay, of course.
You just have to keep make make sure you keep on doing a good job.
Eventually, um, you know, they're going to seek back your service and uh, even tell their friends about it, right?
Word amount.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Always the best out there.
Have you done any type of ads in the local paper, radio, TV or anything online?
No, just uh, just a website that we have and but nothing else.
Okay.
Well, see, here's actually the reason I called uh, Hector, okay?
My company 411 locals, we specialize in uh, watching traffic of search terms on the internet and we do see a significant amount of traffic going on from people searching for your service.
And if we talk about uh, Tacoma, that area alone for the past 30 days, I'm seeing here a total of over 22,908 searches from people looking for electrical services.
That's insane, right?
That's a lot of searches.
Yeah.
That is a lot.
So, yeah, imagine this Hector, somebody out there goes online to go to Google and they type in electric uh electrician near me, even if they don't know you, they're going to see your website, your company name popping up in first page of Google in front of them.
That should be very beneficial for your business, right?
Yeah, anything is uh, right now we're super, super busy.
Already.
But if I send you five jobs right now, are you going to turn them all down or how many can you take?
I have turned jobs down actually uh from the repeat customers just because we're already too busy and we got new construction going.
Okay.
I'm I'm literally stressing myself and uh, maybe like after January, after the holidays, I may may hire another crew, you know, add another crew and at least one more journeyman, competent person that can run a job.
But right now it's just myself and I I don't want to take any more jobs right now before the holidays, before the end of the year.
But after January, I'm going to start looking to that because uh, to share the workload, it won't won't hurt getting any more projects because we can um spread it out, you know, delegate a little more some jobs, then they'll be that'll make sense.
But right now, before the end of the year, I don't want to even because I already turned out jobs and I don't want to add more to my plate because I'm already full basically.
Okay.
But after January, after January beginning of February, I will go to uh do something like that, yes.
I love to follow you back place.
Okay, I guess I'll follow you back place.
But January then next month, all right?
Appreciate it.
Yeah, what's your what's your name, sir?
What's your name?
Uh, it's Darwin.
Darwin, Darwin.
That's Yeah.
All right.
Darwin.
Yeah, give me a call uh, I I want to say end of January and then by then I'll probably have something lined up another hire somebody else.
Okay.
All right.
Another another crew.
I want another crew, you know.
I got an eye on somebody, but I want to make sure they're the right fit.
So uh, another crew.
Um, right now, I don't want to even add anymore because we're already full basically turned down jobs.
Okay.
We got a couple of reconstruction jobs.
We got a couple of reconstruction jobs.
And yeah, Louis Electric calls got lower.
All night all day all night.
I I call ourselves all day all night electric right now.
I'm that makes sense, you know.
You you get yourself too busy, can't handle all those work uh coming into you, right?
So.
Right.
But yeah, you're obviously doing a good job, keeping yourself busy.
Um, appreciate you.
Yeah, yeah.
Definitely.
Take care.
Yeah, uh so end of end of January, let's check it let's look back and we'll see.
I might want to do that.

Mande, sÃ­game, sÃ­game, sin jefazo. Para, para que me sale la llamada de primero, ustedes hacen marketing, hacen website y todo eso, Â¿verdad? SÃ­, seÃ±or. SÃ­, seÃ±or. Okay. Mire. Correcto. Yo hice, yo hice una website hace 2 aÃ±os. Â¿SÃ­? A ver. Mhm. La tuve, la tuve por, por 2 aÃ±os y, por 2 aÃ±os y medio. Mhm. Y y no le, no le saquÃ© ni un resultado, ni un resultado, nada. No me llamaban, solo miraban la pÃ¡gina y no me llamÃ³ nadie. No agarrÃ© ni un, ni un patrÃ³n agarrÃ© con esa website. O sea, Â¿quÃ© quÃ© pasÃ³? Â¿QuÃ© pasarÃ­a ahÃ­? Â¿Ya tiene usted alguna idea mÃ¡s o menos? SÃ­, bueno, precisamente a veces se hace una pÃ¡gina orgÃ¡nica y no se optimiza correctamente y tal cual. SÃ­. OrgÃ¡nico significa que la gente tenga que poner el nombre de su negocio en Google para encontrarlo, Â¿verdad? Ahora, la gente que busca sus servicios no pone el nombre, Â¿verdad? Pues siempre pone el servicio que busca. Por ejemplo, haga landscaping y ponga compaÃ±Ã­a de landscaping cerca de mÃ­. EstÃ¡n muchos factores. A veces puede ser que a veces no hacen los backlinks correctamente con las aplicaciones para que Google lo reconozca mÃ¡s. Dos, hay veces que pues eh si no tiene muchas reviews no le ayuda mucho. O tres, la tercera viene siendo que fue orgÃ¡nico simplemente lo que le hicieron y lo que hizo usted, Â¿verdad? Desafortunadamente, cuando vienen a una mÃ¡s experiencia y me cuentan esto es porque siempre es orgÃ¡nico. No normalmente y pues nunca tienen resultados porque pues la gente para encontrarlo siempre tiene que poner el nombre de la compaÃ±Ã­a y asÃ­ no sucede, Â¿no? O sea, la optimizaciÃ³n se toma poquito tiempo pero funciona bien ya que se requiera a a que se la optimizaciÃ³n completamente bien, Â¿okay? O sea, es lo que hacemos acÃ¡. TambiÃ©n hacemos, este, la optimizaciÃ³n eh no solamente completa en su Ã¡rea, sino que basado a lo que usted ofrece, que en este caso creo que es landscaping, Â¿no? Lo que usted se se se enfoca, Â¿verdad, seÃ±or? Especialista. Mire, mi Mire, mi mi licencia estÃ¡ para hacer todo, todo. Okay. Pero pero mi mi, mis anuncios estÃ¡n en landscaping, Facebook y todo eso, y todo lo que estÃ¡ en mis anuncios. Okay, quiero explicarle tambiÃ©n. Entonces, la la seÃ±ora que me hizo esa website me dijo que si la podÃ­a renovar. Yo no puedo renovarla, ya le dije, ""Ya la renovÃ© por, por 2 aÃ±os y no agarrÃ© ni un patrÃ³n por eso por tener esa website."" Y usted sabe que uno, uno necesita invertir, si no hay, si no hay trabajo, no hay dinero para invertir. SÃ­. SÃ­. Â¿CuÃ¡nto le cobraban ahÃ­ con la seÃ±ora esa? Ah, ella casi no me cobrÃ³ mucho, me cobrÃ³ poco. SÃ­, hace, hace 2 aÃ±os. Ya, ya ni mucho me acuerdo cuÃ¡nto me cobrÃ³, pero no me cobrÃ³ mucho. Mhm. Este, fÃ­jese que el la la cosa, la, la cosa estÃ¡ que yo necesito una persona que me ayude a agarrar clientes. Â¿SÃ­? Una, quiero ver si mi website tiene, tiene cÃ³mo apuntar mi correo electrÃ³nico. Ya de ahÃ­ se mete usted a mi pÃ¡gina ahÃ­ y va a ver. No, ya, ya la encontrÃ© ahorita. Apenas la estoy viendo. SÃ­, la pÃ¡gina estÃ¡ bonita, pues de hecho estÃ¡ bien, hasta estÃ¡ bien hecha, pues, Â¿verdad? Exacto. Pero pues, imagÃ­nese que es como si nadie la estÃ¡ viendo, pues no funciona, Â¿verdad? Entonces, es lo que estÃ¡ cayendo, Â¿verdad? FÃ­jese que todos me dicen, ""Tu la la website estÃ¡ bien hecha."" Ahora, SÃ­, estamos. hay un problema, dicen, ""Hay un problema, por quÃ© no se comunican contigo."" Entonces, otros me dicen que la el correo electrÃ³nico no estÃ¡, no estÃ¡ relatado con la website y asÃ­. PedÃ­ ayuda que me me la arreglaran, pero dice que no se puede arreglar, que hay que hacer otra de nuevo y y asÃ­. Hay que hacer otra website. Antes de que continÃºe. Mhm. En la pÃ¡gina web, no importa que su correo electrÃ³nico no tenga login ni nada. El Google My Business, es que son dos cosas para explicÃ¡rselo bien, Â¿okay? Mira, ahÃ­ le va. EstÃ¡ la pÃ¡gina web, jefe, y luego el Google My Business, el perfil de Google, para que salga en el mapa. SÃ­. Â¿Okay? AhÃ­ te va. El perfil de Google, AjÃ¡. a veces, ya ve que tiene su correo electrÃ³nico para que le hagan el estado de Google. Por ejemplo, usted para meterse en login a eso, usted tendrÃ­a que meterse en Google con el correo electrÃ³nico donde hizo usted perfil y tiene que poner en Google, tapearle Google My Business profile. Y ahÃ­ luego luego va a ver si tiene acceso o no. EstÃ¡ muy simple, jefe, Â¿okay? Y ya si hizo algÃºn caso. SÃ­, porque yo no. DÃ­game, a ver. FÃ­jese que yo no estudiÃ© computaciÃ³n, pues, no, no viera que me cuesta, este. Ah, no se preocupe. Comienzo, por eso pago para hacer eso. SÃ­, porque no, no me dieron estudio en computaciÃ³n y, este, pues yo cuando voy a las librerÃ­as a pedir favor de que me a que me ayuden a, este, a ver cuÃ¡l es el problema de la website, por quÃ© no se comunican conmigo, por eso a mÃ­ me cuesta. SÃ­. SÃ­. AjÃ¡. Ah, ya, no se preocupe. Mire, Mire. Ese perfil de Google, digamos que usted quiera la misma que tenÃ­a antes, la pura pÃ¡gina de Google, estamos hablando, no la pÃ¡gina web, Â¿okay? La pÃ¡gina de Google, Â¿okay? SÃ­. Usted tiene acceso a ese correo electrÃ³nico o ya perdiÃ³ el acceso, el login, pues, las contraseÃ±as se le olvidÃ³ o lo perdiÃ³ o algo, Â¿quÃ© pasÃ³ con eso? No, no. AquÃ­ tengo, el correo electrÃ³nico estÃ¡ bien, es que estÃ¡ Arevalo 73. Ah, okay, perfecto. Â¿Quiere, quiere, quiere, estÃ¡ usted en en mi, en mi perfil usted ahÃ­? SÃ­, estoy viendo su pÃ¡gina y perfil de Google. AhÃ­ le va, no no se precipite. Mire, lo que dice de la pÃ¡gina web ahora, que en su pÃ¡gina web sale un correo electrÃ³nico que estÃ¡ malo, eso no, eso es, no es como que sea mentira, Â¿verdad? La informaciÃ³n tiene que estar correctamente en todo, Â¿verdad? Pero no afecta nada la optimizaciÃ³n que es su correo electrÃ³nico no estÃ© bien, eso es otra cosa, Â¿okay? Lo voy a poner muy simple, se lo voy a explicar asÃ­ de la forma mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil, Â¿okay? Jefe, usted me va a entender perfectamente, Â¿okay? En Google, AjÃ¡. en Google, con que mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n tenga en lÃ­nea, mÃ¡s le va a ayudar en la optimizaciÃ³n porque Google le lo reconoce mÃ¡s usted. AhÃ­ le va. Â¿Por quÃ©? Si ahorita yo buscara Arevalo Landscaping LLC o su puro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono, ahorita estamos viendo que tiene su pÃ¡gina web y su perfil de Google nada mÃ¡s, hasta ahÃ­. Y creo que una pÃ¡gina como de red social no mÃ¡s. Â¿QuÃ© sucede ahÃ­? Usted no mÃ¡s estÃ¡ en tres partes. Â¿QuÃ© pasa aquÃ­? Nosotros tenemos que agregar algo en mÃ¡s aplicaciones y hacer eso a un backlink, como un enlace a su perfil de Google. Una. Mhm. En las aplicaciones donde te con te pongamos seÃ±or Arevalo, tenemos que poner su poner su informaciÃ³n correctamente como lo tienen en su perfil de Google. SÃ­. Para que te ayude mÃ¡s con la optimizaciÃ³n y con el ranking. Â¿CÃ³mo se llama ese proceso? Se llama situaciones en lÃ­nea. De hecho, si usted, si usted escribe ""situaciones en Google"", ""situaciones en lÃ­nea para Google My Business"", va a haber ese mismo proceso que nosotros harÃ­amos por usted para que le ayude con los ranking y optimizaciÃ³n. Eso de las palabras claves que usted diga, ""Oye, si pongo landscaping cerca de mÃ­ no aparezco, es porque no estÃ¡ optimizÃ¡ndose de esa manera y aparte porque no hay funcionamiento de palabras claves a trabajando con sus backlinks."" Entonces, es lo que se ocupa trabajar. Se la pongo muy simple. Si usted a empezar el dÃ­a de hoy con nosotros, Â¿quÃ© puede esperar por el proceso, cuÃ¡nto tiempo dura, cÃ³mo serÃ­a? Â¿Okay? AhÃ­ le va. Nosotros en el mes nÃºmero uno trabajamos con toda su plataforma, creamos el la base de todo esto para que en el primer nÃºmero uno salgan su cÃ³digo postal en su Ã¡rea. En su cÃ³digo postal sÃ­ va a poder salir en la primera pÃ¡gina. Bajo una lista de cinco palabras claves largas, que es una long tail keyword. SerÃ­an por ejemplo para usted, landscaping service near by me o cosas relacionadas a su servicio, los diga tambiÃ©n para que le funcione bien. En el segundo mes se mejora 17 palabras claves y a mÃ¡s cÃ³digos postales alrededor contigo, no en toda la ciudad, porque si tiene en cuenta que es una ciudad de grande, de de grande, de mÃ¡s de 2 millones de personas, Â¿okay? Para cubrirle toda la ciudad de Seattle, imagÃ­nese, puede tardar desde lo mÃ­nimo de 6 meses o mÃ¡ximo 1 aÃ±o o 10 meses, Â¿okay? No significa que no va a haber ningÃºn resultado, sino que simplemente lo que tarde para que tenga mÃ¡ximo resultados por la optimizaciÃ³n del anuncio para que cubra mÃ¡s Ã¡reas, Â¿okay? Pero primeramente serÃ­a su cÃ³digo postal, segundo, mÃ¡s cÃ³digos postales alrededor contigo y despuÃ©s la ciudad constantemente, Â¿okay? Pero tarde el tiempecito. La inversiÃ³n pues sÃ­ vale la pena porque pues, digamos que usted a los 6 meses llega que agarre unos cinco trabajos, pues ya valiÃ³ la pena porque no tuvo que mÃ¡s, pagan mucho y de ahÃ­ mismo se pagÃ³, Â¿verdad? AhÃ­ le va seÃ±or Arevalo. Ya. Exactamente. DÃ­game. Espere. Le voy a decir cuando ya pueda. necesario. Hay otro servicio que se llama patrocinado Google Ads, pero ese se paga a Google directamente. Ese le cobran por click. Ese si no quiere esperarse 6 meses para que estÃ© con la primera pÃ¡gina en Google todo Seattle, ese en ese sale vivo en 7 a 10 dÃ­as. Ese programa es un cobro por click. Si alguien le hiciera click a su anuncio ahÃ­ le pueden cobrar de $2.18 a mÃ¡ximo $5.19 entre eso, dependiente, dependiendo cuÃ¡l sea su industria, cuÃ¡l sea su ciudad. En ese, en ese de patrocinado, si usted quiere cubrir Seattle y otra ciudad al mismo tiempo, lo puede hacer. Â¿Por quÃ©? No se ocupa elecciÃ³n para para verificar la cuenta con Google con video. Ese directamente paga uno a Google directamente para que cubra la ciudad que usted quiera. Dos, ese viene siendo como un comercial tipo sÃ­, Â¿por quÃ©? Se puede poner a schedule. Â¿QuÃ© es un schedule? Que usted ponga que lo quiera tener de las 8 de la maÃ±ana a 5 de la tarde en vivo el anuncio y ya despuÃ©s se apaga. Una, para que su presupuesto te dure mÃ¡s y dos, para que tampoco en la noche alguien le dÃ© click y le cobren, porque en la noche quiÃ©n va a buscar su servicio, pues nadie, Â¿verdad? Pura gente que estÃ¡ buscando cosas que no, Â¿verdad? Entonces, ese se maneja mejor, es mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido, nada mÃ¡s que es una inversiÃ³n mÃ¡s agresiva, pues poquito mÃ¡s agresiva, pero si busca algo muy rÃ¡pido pues vale mÃ¡s la pena pues, porque le digo, sale en vivo casi de 7, una semana, 10 dÃ­as, depende cual agarre. Y la tercera opciÃ³n que tenemos nosotros es la de lead generation. No sÃ© si usted ha escuchado una aplicaciÃ³n que vende leads, que le vende leads, el puro cliente potencial. No. Â¿No? No. Ese nosotros prÃ¡cticamente, nosotros hacemos el anuncio, no bajo su nombre, pero en redes sociales y ese anuncio la gente llena una forma, pero preguntando informaciÃ³n de su servicio, o sea, esperando tu llamada. La gente pondrÃ¡ su nombre, nombre y el servicio que buscan. Nosotros le mandamos ese contacto usted directamente y a usted le toca hablarles, Â¿verdad? Y y y ofrecerle un estimado, con una cita. Pero ese en vez de que usted ellos hablen a usted directamente, ellos van a esperar una llamada de usted, es mÃ¡s diferente obviamente, Â¿por quÃ©? Si usted le habla a una lead, hay veces que no le contestan porque estÃ¡ en buzÃ³n de voz, estÃ¡ manejando y pues le puede fallar poquito la inversiÃ³n pues. Por eso el anuncio en Google es mejor porque ellos le hablan a usted directamente, pues sÃ­ vale mÃ¡s la pena, pero depende cual agarre tambiÃ©n, Â¿okay? SÃ­. Pero le damos las opciones, pues, Â¿verdad? Eh eh esa de tener una pÃ¡gina como la que usted tiene ahorita orgÃ¡nica, pues nosotros la tenemos muy barato y lo otro de de optimizaciÃ³n pues puede variar el precio desde los 121 a mÃ¡ximo 365, dependiendo cual sea su cÃ³digo postal, entre eso. Â¿Okay? Â¿CuÃ¡nto, si en los 6 meses, cuÃ¡nto, cuÃ¡nto me salen los 6 meses en los 6 meses? Eh. Â¿CuÃ¡l es, cuÃ¡l es el cÃ³digo postal para darle un, para decirle cuÃ¡nto, cuÃ¡nto sale en su Ã¡rea? 981 98173. Oh, solo, este, es que mire, en cada Ã¡rea hay un cÃ³digo, ese es el problema. SÃ­. Que no, no puedo yo decirle, o sea, le doy mi cÃ³digo pero es que en cada sector hay un cÃ³digo. Deme el cÃ³digo postal de la direcciÃ³n de oficina o de su negocio mÃ¡s bien en este caso. De mi negocio. Eh, donde estÃ¡ ubicado el negocio. La direcciÃ³n. No, es que yo no tengo oficina, yo solo, yo soy como los, yo soy principiante, pues, soy, estoy todavÃ­a asÃ­, este, o sea, agarrando clientes y ah, soy principiante. Okay. AhÃ­ le va. SÃ­. Entonces, serÃ­a el cÃ³digo postal de donde estÃ¡ la compaÃ±Ã­a eh de su direcciÃ³n mÃ¡s bien, acÃ¡ en su oficina, apartamento, oficina, la, el cÃ³digo postal no mÃ¡s, no la direcciÃ³n completa. El puro zip code, Â¿cuÃ¡l serÃ­a? Mi el cÃ³digo del, de todo es 98178, es de la, es del Ã¡rea. Okay. SÃ­. Es donde vive usted, Â¿verdad? PrÃ¡cticamente, Â¿verdad, eso? SÃ­. Y hay y hay, sÃ­ tiene clientes ahÃ­, jefe, sÃ­ trabaja o no tanto realmente, porque estÃ¡, estÃ¡ chiquita el Ã¡rea donde estÃ¡ usted. No, fÃ­jese que no, no, no tengo, no tengo clientes ahorita. Estoy buscando clientes, sÃ­. SÃ­, seÃ±or. Estoy buscando clientes por eso. Apenas comenzÃ³, Â¿quÃ© tiempo su compaÃ±Ã­a tiene? Ah, apenas, este, ahorita voy a cumplir 2 aÃ±os, 2 aÃ±os voy a tener. Ah, y estÃ¡ muy bien. SÃ­, 2 aÃ±os. Tal vez sÃ­ ya llevo un poquito mÃ¡s, ya llevo un poquito mÃ¡s de de 2 aÃ±os ya. SÃ­. Pienso. Okay. Pero yo lo que le digo que me hicieron es, me hicieron esa, esa este, website y no, no yo no, yo no puedo invertir porque yo no no me no me genera trabajo y no tengo dinero para invertir. Ese es el problema. Â¿SÃ­? Porque yo, mi licencia, mire, mi licencia estÃ¡ para hacer pintura, para hacer spray, para hacer este, este, para hacer este, limpiar techos, este, limpiar gares y todo eso, todo eso, hacer landscaping, tirar y echar tierra, ya, echar bark, top soil, pavers, ya, hacer hacer frame de, eh, o sea, todo esos cercas, todo es decks, SÃ­. ya, fencing, todo eso estÃ¡ en mi licencia para hacer todo eso. Mire, el anuncio, por ejemplo, es que es por temporada, ahorita que estÃ¡, creo que estÃ¡ lloviendo con usted, o hay nieve o algo, estÃ¡ frÃ­o con usted, Â¿no? El tiempo, Â¿no? O sea, estÃ¡n, estÃ¡n lloviendo y todo, Â¿verdad? O sea, todo varÃ­a, Â¿verdad? SÃ­. AquÃ­ ya llevan, Mira, aquÃ­ ya llevan 10 dÃ­as de que no ha parado la lluvia, 10 dÃ­as. SÃ­, es lo que le digo. SÃ­. ImagÃ­nese que usted anuncie correctamente y puro landscaping, pues no va a tener ningÃºn cliente porque pues no lo van a buscar, Â¿verdad? Es es por temporada tambiÃ©n, pues, eso tiene que ver muchÃ­simo, jefe. Entonces, a usted le convendrÃ­a ponerse como general contractor o como remodeling company, para que haya remodelaciones or general construction, right? Eh, ese a lo mejor fue un motor error, Â¿verdad? Pero es que fue orgÃ¡nico simplemente, es eso tambiÃ©n, Â¿verdad? Entonces, eh, se lo pongo muy simple. AjÃ¡. Si usted se pusiera como home improvement remodel or general contractor en la optimizaciÃ³n, sÃ­ le convendrÃ­a mÃ¡s porque serÃ­a puro es, para puro eso de lo que usted busca, pintura, drywall, roofing or concrete work, Â¿okay? Mhm. AjÃ¡. Es que depende a la la industria tambiÃ©n, Â¿okay? Es es, por ejemplo, si usted se registraba landscaping y haga puro trabajo de jardinerÃ­a y y estÃ© en en un lugar donde nieva, en diciembre no va a tener nada, Â¿verdad? Porque estÃ¡n, es es lo mismo, Â¿verdad? Entonces, es dependiendo del lugar tambiÃ©n. No, correcto. Para enero nieva bastante aquÃ­ en Seattle, nieva. Es lo que le digo. Nieva para enero. SÃ­. Exactamente, entonces ahÃ­ tiene que ver muchÃ­simo. Entonces, yo puedo, puedo hacer gabinetes, puedo hacer parches de chirock, puedo poner chirock, puedo tapear chirock y todo eso, puedo. Pero mi licencia solo, o sea, mi anuncio dice solo jardinerÃ­a o jardinerÃ­a y este, Este. ahÃ­, no, bueno, hay varios, hay varios Arevalo Landscaping. Yo quiero preguntarle en quÃ© Arevalo Landscaping estÃ¡ usted metido. Quiero preguntarle primero. Eh. Nosotros tenemos el sistema con el puro nÃºmero de, mira, nosotros tenemos un sistema Creo que me va a ayudar. SÃ­. para nuestros clientes, con poner el nÃºmero, el puro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono podemos encontrar su perfil de Google o su pÃ¡gina, lo que tenga o Yelp, Â¿verdad? Nosotros con el puro, el nÃºmero de telÃ©fono lo encontramos y si sale la que tiene, dÃ©jeselo mando lo que estoy viendo, Â¿okay? Para que vea que SÃ­, porque hay un montÃ³n de, hay un montÃ³n de Arevalo Landscaping. Hay muchÃ­simos. Ay, un montÃ³n. Yo sÃ©, jefe, sÃ­, sÃ­. AhÃ­ le mandÃ© mi ID. Entonces usted tiene que Yo le pregunto. SÃ­, porque si, si usted no estÃ¡ en mi pÃ¡gina, pues yo creo que no, no, usted le va a trabajar a otra persona, Â¿sÃ­? No, no, seÃ±or, no se preocupe. Mire, eh, usted tiene dos reviews en su pÃ¡gina de Google, eh, su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono 206-661-0861, es su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono usted y su pÃ¡gina web es la que tiene, este, Seattle, Washington, tiene el, el TikTok ahÃ­ conectado hasta eso y su, y tiene verde y su, y su nombre en, en amarillo anaranjado, algo asÃ­, Â¿verdad? Ah, lo tengo. Eh, pero mire, digo, todo eso. Mhm. Â¿Correo electrÃ³nico? El correo electrÃ³nico lo que, es lo que le preocupa a usted, lo que ve, Â¿verdad? Quisiera cambiarlo, me dice, Â¿ah? Dejo, checo, jefe. No, no, no. No, no lo quiero cambiar. EstÃ¡ bien el correo electrÃ³nico, nada mÃ¡s que quiero asociarlo a la pÃ¡gina web porque dice que no estÃ¡, no estÃ¡, este, es lo que me dicen. AhÃ­ le va, sale, sale, ahÃ­ le va, mira, sale Arevalo landscaping73@gmail.com. Es lo que me marca acÃ¡. SÃ­. Ese mero, ese es. Â¿SÃ­? Ah, es que mire, este, es que yo soy muy franco. Hay muchas compaÃ±Ã­as que van a ofrecerle promociÃ³n, jefe, y yo le soy muy franco, nomÃ¡s que pues hay unos que le echan una mentirÃ­a, pues, Â¿verdad? Por ejemplo, hay miles de compaÃ±Ã­as que van a llamarle, le van a decirle que son parte de Google, pero eso es mentira, ni si quiera Google le va a hablar. Lo que nosotros somos, somos una compaÃ±Ã­a que sÃ­ estÃ¡ certificada con Google. No somos Google, pero estamos certificados con ellos. Hay mÃ¡s de 1,000 compaÃ±Ã­as que ofrecen lo mismo. Le digo, la certificaciÃ³n que tenemos con Google solamente eh creo que 45 compaÃ±Ã­as la tenemos aquÃ­ en Estados Unidos. Esa que le mandÃ© es certificado, usted vÃ©alo, va a decir 411locals.com, es, tiene un rÃ©dito del 60% de definiciÃ³n para el anuncio y cumple con tÃ©rminos y condiciones para estar certificado con Google. Y sale todo el nombre ahÃ­ tambiÃ©n. De hecho, en la pÃ¡gina de Google directa, si usted se metiera certificacionescongoogle.com, va a haber 411 locals ahÃ­ tambiÃ©n, el nÃºmero de ese negocio. Eso muchas compaÃ±Ã­as no lo tienen, Â¿okay? Entonces, le voy a, le voy a contar. Mande. FÃ­jese que yo andaba, los trabajos que he agarrado es que he ido a tirar tarjetas, pero me han regaÃ±ado por tirar tarjetas. Fui a dejar tarjetas en un buzÃ³n y me dice y un seÃ±or me dijo, ""Mira, Â¿por quÃ© no haces una, por quÃ© no haces una website?"", me dijo, ""Â¿Por quÃ© no haces una website? Deja de estar tocando los buzones y hace una website"", me dijo. AsÃ­ me dijo. SÃ­, sÃ­, jefe, mire. SÃ­, pero no, mira, eso de en los, en los buzones no se puede tocar, pero sÃ­ puede ponerlo en la puerta. Eso sÃ­ se puede y yo conozco negocios de landscaping que andan en jardinerÃ­a y hasta tocan puertas, seÃ±or. SÃ­ se puede, no pueden decirle nada. Obviamente, si usted se mete a una actividad que es HOA, que es Home Association, algo asÃ­, Â¿verdad? Ya ves que los HOAs es privado, ahÃ­ sÃ­ los hasta los sacan eh la seguridad, ahÃ­ es privado, pues. Pero si es acÃ¡ pÃºblico, obviamente si la gente se enoja pues obviamente hasta la policÃ­a le va a hablar, ya ves como son, Â¿no? Pero a los que no, puede tocar hasta la puerta, no pasa nada, porque uno ya estÃ¡ registrada su compaÃ±Ã­a, tiene su su LLC, tal, usted estÃ¡ legal, pues. Hay compaÃ±Ã­as que ni siquiera tienen registraciÃ³n como usted, jefe, y ni ni aseguranza y asÃ­ andan, fÃ­jese eh. Y andan por aquÃ­ por si trabajan asÃ­, pues, pero usted anda bien, no pueden decirle nada, ni siquiera la ciudad. Creo que si usted va a la ciudad pues son permisos de nada, hasta eso, Â¿verdad? Para que no lo moleste nadie, Â¿verdad? Mire, mi licencia Manden. Mi licencia estÃ¡ para trabajar en, en residencial, comercial de residencial comercial, pero mi licencia no dice residencial comercial tampoco. No, mi licencia, yo puedo trabajar en todas esas Ã¡reas, pero en privado no. Bueno, asÃ­ como en colonias privadas tambiÃ©n tambiÃ©n yo tengo acceso para eso, pero mi licencia no dice residencial, o sea, mi anuncio no dice residencial comercial, solo dice landscaping, nomÃ¡s asÃ­, y estÃ¡ el Ã¡rea tengo 80 80, este, este millas alrededor de Seattle, Â¿sÃ­? Mhm. SÃ­. Eso es lo que tengo, 80 millas lo que cubro, pero eh la website no no no funciona. Â¿Por quÃ© no funciona? Es mi pregunta. No, no estÃ¡ optimizada, seÃ±or, estÃ¡ orgÃ¡nica, pues. Mire, ahÃ­ le va. Le voy a mandar una pÃ¡gina donde usted va a ver el nÃºmero de su licencia, de todo, Â¿okay? Ya se lo mando, Â¿okay? PermÃ­tame. PermÃ­tame. Â¿Y usted vive en Arizona? No, nosotros estamos aquÃ­ en 8201, eh, por acÃ¡ aquÃ­ en Las Vegas, Nevada, seÃ±or. No, no estamos en Arizona. Â¿En dÃ³nde vive usted? En Las Vegas, seÃ±or. Ya se lo mando. Oh. Mire, en la pÃ¡gina que le mandÃ©, de Vicapia, creo que sÃ­ es usted porque sale de el de en agosto 20 eh 2023. El 22 de agosto usted la registrÃ³, creo, Â¿verdad? Â¿Correcto? En en dÃ³nde lo mandÃ³, en WhatsApp? AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© por mensaje de texto normal. AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© mi ID. A WhatsApp no tenemos, seÃ±or, por el sistema no no nos dejan usarlo. Por un mensaje de texto y correo electrÃ³nico. AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© mi ID. A ver, dÃ©jame ver. Mensaje de texto. AhÃ­, jefe. El que le acabo de mandar, un link dice Dice, ""AquÃ­ puede ver nÃºmeros de licencia"", dice. SÃ­, jefe. AhÃ­ en esa pÃ¡gina usted va a ver su informaciÃ³n de su registro que tiene. De hecho, ahÃ­ sale su direcciÃ³n y todo, Â¿verdad? Eh eh el nÃºmero de folio que usted tiene es 605-315727. Pero si ya es usted, Â¿verdad? Eh, aquÃ­ puede ver que estÃ¡ registrado en el estado de Washington. Â¿Correcto? SÃ­. Y tiene su limited liability company. Â¿Verdad? Entonces, aquÃ­ en esa pÃ¡gina puede checar todo usted, de su informaciÃ³n. No sÃ© si usted sabÃ­a eso cuando lo registraron. Es que normalmente sÃ­ le dicen, pero hay veces que no le dicen, Â¿verdad? Pero vÃ©alo, chÃ©quelo. AhÃ­ estÃ¡ muy bueno, Â¿verdad? Y tambiÃ©n, este, Â¿quÃ© mÃ¡s? La, mira, hay tarjetas de negocio digitales tambiÃ©n. Yo le mandÃ© una que tengo con una compaÃ±Ã­a de landscaping que le hicimos a Ã©l, pero digital, con cÃ³digo QR y todo. Nosotros ahÃ­ le pegamos su pÃ¡gina web, cÃ³digo QR, redes sociales y todo. AhÃ­ le mandÃ© la muestra. Pero es una compaÃ±Ã­a real de landscaping, nomÃ¡s que estÃ¡ en en Borlensen, Iowa, Â¿okay? Entonces, le digo, o sea, son puras compaÃ±Ã­as que tiene experiencia para la promociÃ³n en Estados Unidos, CanadÃ¡, MÃ©xico, Australia y Bulgaria, donde usted le cubrimos, Â¿okay? Ah, esta compaÃ±Ã­a que le estoy hablando se llama 411 locals, tiene desde 2007 haciendo promociÃ³n digital y ha trabajado con 30,000 compaÃ±Ã­as. Yo yo apenas tengo aquÃ­ en en esta compaÃ±Ã­a trabajando eh 3 aÃ±os casi ya, Â¿okay? Entonces, a lo que a a lo que iba a estar esto es lo que yo hago aquÃ­. Mi trabajo es ofrecer la promociÃ³n. Si lo hace, pues le registraremos su cuenta, si no, pues no pasa nada, Â¿verdad? Es lo que yo hago, Â¿okay? SÃ­ se puede, sÃ­ se puede, se puede redactar otra website con la misma presentaciÃ³n o no? Ah, como, mire, sÃ­, jefe, con el mismo, con el mismo diseÃ±o, porque dice que no se puede arreglar esa o sÃ­ se puede arreglar esa? AhÃ­ le va. Si usted se registra con nosotros, es es mejor que usemos la de nosotros porque una, ya viene incluido en el paquete, dos, para que la informaciÃ³n que en Google estÃ© directo y y para que estÃ© conectado todo seguramente ahora sÃ­ bien, pues es mejor hacerlo de esa forma para cumplir todos los reglamentos que tiene Google, Â¿okay? Â¿Para que se ponga? No me dijo cuÃ¡l era el precio del No me dijo cuÃ¡l era el precio de los 6 meses. AhÃ­ le va. Ah, okay. Eh, dÃ©jame ver, 6 meses. 6 por Â¿QuÃ© es este? SerÃ­a como general contractor, Â¿verdad? PermÃ­tame, deja checo. Landscaping. Landscaping con todo, este, le querÃ­a poner remodela, ajÃ¡. Â¿RemodelaciÃ³n, verdad? Ah, no, no podrÃ­a remodelaciÃ³n. Solo pintura, pintura y piso de madera, este, eso pondrÃ­a. Landscaping. Pero eso ya, eso lo podrÃ­amos hablar antes. Casi lo tengo en mi tarjeta. Yo solo le mando mi tarjeta ya. SÃ­, ahÃ­ le va. Mira, si usted trabaja con nosotros 6 meses son 1,829.94, Â¿verdad? 1,800.00. SÃ­, sÃ­, 6 meses pegados, pero nosotros no hacemos que firme nada, aquÃ­ es de mes a mes. El servicio con nosotros es pospago automÃ¡tico recurrente. Â¿QuÃ© es pospago? Eh digamos que usted empezaba conmigo el dÃ­a de hoy, Â¿verdad? Que empiece con los 49.99 y se quedaba conmigo hasta el dÃ­a 16 de enero. SerÃ­an 304.99 dividido, pues, por mes, Â¿verdad? Ahora, de ese, de ese 16 de enero al 18, hasta el 18 de enero, supongamos que usted se vaya y ya no trabaje con nosotros, se cobran por los dos dÃ­as trabajados. Eso significa pospago. O sea, se cobran por lo trabajado, no lo que no estÃ¡ hecho aÃºn. Â¿Tiene sentido? SÃ­. Entonces, eso sale el paquete, pues 49.99, escribirlo con el programa, activar la cuenta y ya si usted se queda con nosotros mes a mes son 304.99. Ahora, si podemos darle la opciÃ³n de pagar 6 meses adelantado, pero preferimos empezar de poco a poco para que usted tambiÃ©n vea cÃ³mo funciona el programa y tambiÃ©n sea, no nuestra compaÃ±Ã­a es performance based. Viene siendo lo que nosotros hacemos, por eso no hacemos que firme nada nunca, pues, es de mes a mes. No, porque la hecha, la hecha de la website, La website serÃ­a de crear una nueva. DÃ©jale mando una muestra, Â¿okay? PermÃ­tame. Si hay que hacer otro nuevo, Â¿eh? SÃ­, seÃ±or. SÃ­, porque mire, el dominio, nosotros no tenemos acceso al dominio para optimizarlo, eso es una. Dos, este, a veces por regulaciones de Google tenemos que hacerlo correctamente con los backlinks, asÃ­ que pues mejor hacerlo uno nuevo. Ahora, si usted ya comprÃ³ esa pÃ¡gina web, comprÃ³ el dominio, usted es el dueÃ±o de eso, hay una posibilidad que la la conectemos a la nueva, Â¿verdad? Para que va a tener prÃ¡cticamente dos pÃ¡ginas, Â¿verdad? Pero ya si no, pues le damos esa opciÃ³n tambiÃ©n, darle la nueva y ya y se acabÃ³ para que uno pague de mÃ¡s. Â¿Le puedo, le puedo hacer una pregunta? Mande, jefe, dÃ­game, sÃ­. Mire, usted puede ver quÃ© dominio tengo yo ahÃ­ en esa pÃ¡gina que tengo? Eh, sÃ­, es difÃ­cil el dominio.

Entonces, difÃ­cil que tenga trÃ¡fico allÃ­, Â¿verdad? Para que tenga visitas. DÃ©jele muestro, mire, se lo voy a poner muy fÃ¡cil. Le mandÃ© una pÃ¡gina de muestra ahorita y le voy a enseÃ±ar una compaÃ±Ã­a que trabaja con nosotros en eso, Â¿no? Para que vea que sÃ­ cÃ³mo funcionarÃ­a si usted lo hace con nosotros, Â¿okay?

Um, we do a lot of interior as well, you know, if you need um, something a whole fixed on the inside or, you know, a wall taken out and put new dry new drywall sheet in, you know, we can do that as well.
There's a lot of different things that we do.
Um, that's why we basically just say, you know, if you want an estimate or a quote, we can just we can go look at it, get pictures and things go from there.
Okay.
Yeah, listen, how do you normally generate new clients, Cassidy?
Like when it comes to people that doesn't know you yet.
I generate new clients in a whole bunch of different ways.
Um, basically I grew add advertisements, um, promote it on my different social media accounts.
Okay.
Um, create videos.
I mean, there's so many different things I do.
I see, I see.
Okay.
Um, because basically the jobs we want you to do, Cassidy, are not for us, basically for the people that search locally when they need them, right?
Um, and and now we have like a spot open on Google.
That's why we're calling you, right?
So, are you guys able to take on some of these jobs, Cassidy?
Of course.
Yeah, of course we are.
Yeah.
Okay, so, um, because I was trying to look for for like have you checked your company on Google lately?
Because we found you I think you're like on online directories, Facebook, right?
I'm on Facebook, yes.
Yeah, of course.
And I I was not able to find like a Google listing for your company, right?
Uh, not as of not as yet, no.
Okay, perfect.
Uh, the reason we're calling you is because well, I mean, within the last 30 days, we have almost like 2,000 searches for painting services.
So my my question is very simple, Cassidy, right?
If we can put you in front of these customers that are looking for your services, do you think that should be beneficial for your business?
Yeah, I definitely think it would be beneficial.
Okay.
Are you the the one that takes the decisions for this company?
Are you the the sole owner?
Um, I'm the administrative office kind of lady.
Um, yeah, my husband does all the I see, I see.
Okay.
My husband does all the building and stuff like that.
I usually take on the jobs, take on the leads and check and see if it's actually worth our time.
Okay.
Got you.
Got you.
Basically, yeah.
Okay, so that's good.
I mean, you got a team, right?
You got you got the perfect team.
You got I mean, you're ladies taking the admin work and the guy, the man is the one doing the action.
Yes, yes, 100%.
And we have a couple other employees as well, so.
Okay, so you have a crew as well that can help you in case that like we have like a big project, you guys can take it on.
You guys can like get more people to help you, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
How far can you travel, Cassidy?
Let's say when it comes to maybe uh, 20, 30, 50 miles radius.
I'd say anywhere from like um, well, I live in we live in Dexter.
So if I were to like put a name on it, the farthest I think we'd travel depending on the price of the job would probably be Augusta and north would probably be around Bangor or no area.
Okay.
And and like I said, depending on the job.
I mean, if there's a Portland job that's like a $3,000 job that's going to be a week, you know, worth the work or whatever, then yeah, we would go down.
But it really depends on what the job is and how long the duration of the job is.
I see.
So what's your local zip code there in Dexter?
Like you said, 88230?
No, it's 04930.
04930.
Let me show what we've got there.
Okay.
All right.
Perfect.
So you don't have no website as of now, yet.
No website, just like social media.
Right.
Yes, so I'm I'm working on building that.
Because you said you advertise.
Um, I'm just trying we we don't have money to or extra money, I should say, to put towards um, any extra advertising.
Um, I did try to put in for a Google um, business.
Right.
However, um, I'm still waiting on that.
So, yeah, you you you're probably on the verification.
Verification status because you need to verify your company on Google.
Um, so they can let you list it.
Okay.
So basically that's what we certify here.
We're Google certified partners, Cassidy, right?
So we'll take care of all that for you, right?
It means like um, we'll do the local SEO, the Google business setup, your website, listing your company on over 50 online directories, like getting all done.
So what you're going to do is just focus on, you know, answer answering the calls, make sure like you say earlier, right?
Those leads are going to, you know, they're going to make sense to you guys.
You know, it's going to be something that you guys are able to do, right?
Um, so you'll be in charge on that and we'll be dealing with the rest.
Is this something that you might want to, you know, have an open mind to listen to it and see what we can do about it if the price is right?
Huh?
Um, well, like I said, I don't really have any extra funds right now though.
I mean, I I'm interested but like we if we had the extra money, I would definitely do it, but we don't have the extra money right this second.
I mean, I'm not asking you for money right now.
Don't worry, we are post-paid service, meaning that we work first and we charge later, right?
Uh, when it comes to to to uh, to our services.
Uh, and we we're very flexible, right?
I mean, I don't think how much you got in mind?
Do you think we're going to charge like $1,000?
I mean, no, I'm just thinking just general money wise.
No, no, no, no.
Basically, so no, we're very flexible.
I'll go ahead and explain the project.
Nothing to compromise, Cassidy.
If you like what you hear, we can move forward.
If not, I mean, we can part ways friends.
Don't worry.
Sounds good?
Okay.
All right.
So listen, the Google listing thing, okay?
Um, yeah, I mean, that's how everybody kind of look for like when they're when they're looking for clothes, any type of service, food, like 80% 80% of people use Google when they're kind of ready to buy, right?
And 90% never scroll scroll past page one.
Uh, I want to compete with those companies that I sent to you.
Do you know any of them?
No.
No?
Did you get them?
The link The link that I sent to you?
No, no, I got them.
I I just don't know them.
Okay.
All right.
So basically, um, I mean, we will be competing with them, right?
Um, what I need you to do is just make sure the clients is going to be talking good about your services because they're going to be able to write a review, you know, under your company name, right?

Speaker B (02:30 - 02:36): You don't know? I think it is totally fine. But you know how Google works nowadays, right?
Speaker C (02:36 - 02:36): Yeah.
Speaker B (02:36 - 02:55): Right. Because really only reason why I'm actually asking you that, because what we are trying to do here as the company is we specializes, okay. In monitoring the number of people that is looking for your services in your area. And we found out that there is.
Speaker A (02:55 - 02:58): An increase of demand for your type.
Speaker B (02:58 - 03:31): Of services because upon checking here for the past 30 days, there are about 367 people that is looking for your type of work. So if we could actually put you right in front of those areas interested customers, that would be very beneficial or that's really a big help for the company as well, right? Yeah, it would be. And let me ask you, do you happen to know these companies? The first one that I have here is through Quality Construction llc. That is the first one I also got here.
Speaker A (03:31 - 03:34): Ridgeline Contractors NW llc.
Speaker B (03:35 - 03:41): And the last one that I'm looking at here is the Nelson Construction imc. Are these companies sounds familiar to you?
Speaker A (03:41 - 03:44): You've heard about them or this is the first time?
Speaker B (03:45 - 03:48): Do you know these companies? No, you don't know them. Okay.
Speaker A (03:48 - 03:52): Which is totally fine. So these companies that I did mention.
Speaker B (03:52 - 03:54): To you, they are the one that.
Speaker A (03:54 - 04:11): Is showing up right now on Google consistently, especially on the first. So obviously they're getting those clients. They are the one who's getting those customers. Because if you are showing up already on Google, people always associate you that you are one of the best and.
Speaker B (04:11 - 04:16): Of course they will gonna follow you naturally. So this is something that we can.
Speaker A (04:16 - 04:20): Definitely help you out. This is the one that we will gonna be working on with your company.
Speaker B (04:20 - 04:28): Does that make sense? Right. But have you heard about our company 411Locals or this would be like the first time?
Speaker C (04:28 - 04:29): First time.
Speaker B (04:29 - 04:49): It's the first time. Okay, let me just send. I did send you a text message right now to your phone. Let me know if you have it. It's coming from 702-29-1765. Do you have it? Nope, I sent it to 206-859-7811. You can receive text message to this number, correct?
Speaker C (04:49 - 04:49): Yes.
Speaker B (04:50 - 04:51): Okay, you've got it.
Speaker C (04:52 - 04:53): What's the number again?
Speaker B (04:53 - 05:02): I sent it to 206-859-7811. It's coming, it's coming from 702-291-7653.
Speaker C (05:03 - 05:03): Right.
Speaker B (05:04 - 05:06): I put there our website, which is.
Speaker A (05:06 - 05:23): 411Locals.Com for you to visit. Okay. I also put there our Google partner badge for you to check and verify that. Yes, our company 411Locals is a Google certified partner and of course one of the clients that we are working with for over four years. Okay.
Speaker B (05:23 - 05:28): So our company, we've been in the business for 18 years now and of.
Speaker A (05:28 - 05:42): Course we have helped over 70,000 customers and counting. And they are actually staying with us because they are getting results. So we will gonna be doing all of the marketing for you. So you don't need to worry that anymore. Make sense?
Speaker C (05:42 - 05:43): Go. Nathan.
Speaker B (05:43 - 06:02): Yeah, I'm sorry, I heard. All right, that's perfect then. So with our company, Eddie, there are three things that we will gonna be helping you out. Okay. Number one is of course we will gonna place your company on the right spot. On the first page, placement of Google under five main keywords that best describe.
Speaker A (06:02 - 06:03): Your most money making services.
Speaker B (06:04 - 06:08): You are familiar with keywords? Like you know how keywords work when.
Speaker A (06:08 - 06:09): It comes to Google?
Speaker B (06:09 - 06:10): Would that be correct?
Speaker C (06:10 - 06:10): Yeah.
Speaker A (06:11 - 06:11): Right.
Speaker B (06:14 - 06:15): Like when was the last time that.
Speaker A (06:15 - 06:16): You did use Google?
Speaker C (06:16 - 06:20): A minute ago? A while ago? Not sure. I don't really use it.
Speaker B (06:20 - 06:25): I see. But if you're actually looking for something on Google, were you able to find.
Speaker A (06:25 - 06:26): The answer on the first page?
Speaker C (06:27 - 06:27): Very much.
Speaker B (06:27 - 06:32): Yeah, pretty much. Okay, so this is the one that we were going to be helping you out.
Speaker A (06:32 - 06:33): Okay. I'm Eddie.
Speaker B (06:33 - 06:39): Because of course not everybody knows about ESR Construction. Not everybody knows that you do offer.
Speaker C (06:41 - 06:42): I'm sorry, you were talking.
Speaker B (06:42 - 06:45): Oh, you're saying something. What was that again?
Speaker C (06:45 - 06:46): Oh no, no, no.
Speaker B (06:47 - 06:53): Right. As I've mentioned to you, not everybody knows about your company, not everybody knows.
Speaker A (06:53 - 06:57): About all of the services that you're actually offering to your customers.
Speaker B (06:57 - 07:09): But of course what customers know is the service that they need and where to get it from. So we want to make sure here that if someone in your area goes online, especially on Google, and they are.
Speaker A (07:09 - 07:15): Actually looking for your type of service, our goal here is you will gonna show up on the first page.
Speaker B (07:15 - 07:27): So the company that they will gonna see on Google would be your company name your information so these customers can get a hold of you directly. So you can always cherry pick the jobs that you want to work with. Make sense?
Speaker C (07:28 - 07:28): Yeah.
Speaker B (07:28 - 07:36): Right. And of course aside from putting on the first page of Google, we are going to submit as well. Okay.
Speaker A (07:36 - 07:50): Your information in over 50 plus online directories or local phone books in the area such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, Manta Merchant Circle, Superpages, even Bing in Yahoo.
Speaker B (07:50 - 07:52): You know those online platforms.
Speaker A (07:52 - 07:54): You know those online listings, right?
Speaker C (07:54 - 07:55): Yeah.
Speaker B (07:55 - 08:04): But have you tried listing your information with one of those? No, you haven't. Okay. Which is totally fine. So that is something that we will going to be helping out as well.
Speaker A (08:04 - 08:07): And good thing with us is you don't need to pay those listings separately.
Speaker B (08:07 - 08:08): Or one by one.
Speaker A (08:09 - 08:21): That is also part of the things that we will going to be helping you out because we want to make sure that regardless if they were going to go to Google or they were going to go to those online listings, the main goal here is they will.
Speaker B (08:22 - 08:29): Always going to find you. So so it would be a 360 degree approach for the business. So customers will gonna see you at.
Speaker A (08:29 - 08:31): Every corner of the Internet and that.
Speaker B (08:31 - 08:40): Is the goal of our company. Makes sense. Right. But any questions so far? Clarifications to make sure that we are on the same page?
Speaker C (08:40 - 08:40): No question.
Speaker B (08:41 - 08:51): Alright, not a problem. And lastly, okay, since View doesn't have a website yet that is up and running, then we can create you one as part of the package.
Speaker A (08:52 - 08:56): Actually I created like a sample template for the website so you're gonna have like a better idea.
Speaker B (08:57 - 08:58): Let me just send it to you.
Speaker A (08:58 - 09:00): Okay, just give me a second here.

Speaker A (00:18 - 00:27): Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Mister Oscar. Yeah. So this is Oscar as well and we're looking for available company to work with and we should increase our customers looking for.
Speaker B (00:42 - 00:53): OK. I've only been with my business for a year, but I've always complied with what the State, license, insurance, everything, everything that corresponds, requires.
Speaker A (00:54 - 01:11): Excellent, excellent, very good. That's very good for being a year in. We have had business owners who have had three, four years and still without a license. It's good that you are doing things right from the beginning, Mr. Oscar. Very good. And I want to think that you already had experience before, right?
Speaker B (01:11 - 01:32): Yes, well, before starting my business, I spent seven years working for some people, so I also had to learn a little more English, so I can also have conversations with builders and homeowners, contractors and all that. So I took on the task of starting my business and here we are.
Speaker A (01:32 - 02:01): Well, it didn't take that long either, seven years in which he learned the trade, in which he learned more new services, in which he also learned to speak English and that he decided, it's good that you made this decision, Mr. Oscar, to make your own money and be your own boss and win. Excellent, because the truth is that remodeling leaves quite well. Very good. And Mr. Oscar, with these seven years of experience that you have, can you do both residential and commercial services or do you focus more on residential?
Speaker B (02:01 - 02:13): Well, I do both, honestly I do both and so far I haven't had any problems, thank God and we've been doing, well, we haven't been doing great, but regularly stable. We are, thank God.
Speaker A (02:13 - 02:31): No, it is understood, the truth is that all businesses when they start, especially the first years, are complicated because people don't know them, they have to be making their name, they have to be making themselves known with the services that you offer. So they go.
Speaker B (02:32 - 03:28): You know, before that, thank God, before starting my business, many clients, I'm not going to say that I took them from those I worked with, no, none of that, but all the clients and all the builders saw that I was always the face, I was the one with the face, my boss rarely arrived or only sent the invoices and all that and the claims, the guarantees, all that was me, it was me. So the clients, both builders, both referral, called me directly, even though I passed them on to the boss, the boss would say no, no, no, just tell me the price you're going to give and then the boss would charge. So thank God, I got a lot of customers when I started my business, so I had the task of going to places and houses and calling, God, this is my business, my insurance and all that and they started calling me quickly, so I talked to my ex-boss and said, don't you think I'm taking them from you? He says no, no, no, all your struggle gave mine, don't worry and I hope you do well.
Speaker A (03:28 - 03:42): Of course, and above all, he learned something that he has to show his face too, maybe and his business is growing, but you are going to show your face and so that they know you have natural hinting and remodeling and who is behind the whole product.
Speaker B (03:42 - 03:42): Exactly.
Speaker A (03:44 - 04:10): You always learn and the truth is that people who adapt to changes, people or business owners who know how to improve those services, not only of organizing but of showing their face, well it also is. Now Mr. Oscar, of the services that you do, because remodeling is broad, what are the services that you should do? Better remunerate your business.
Speaker B (04:10 - 04:44): OK, well look, what I do is the drywall, its roll taping, texture, all that, then comes the cleaning and then comes the painting, after that cleaning also general cleaning, I have other people who do general cleaning, like the people who clean the houses, after you've handed over the house you'll see that there's polo, stains, drops, all that, windows, doors, I have personnel for that and I also do tile, I do flooring, I do different activities, you understand me, Insulation, all that.
Speaker A (04:45 - 05:01): Perfect, very good, well if it is a fairly complete service, until the cleaning there is no dust, the post construction clean. OK, excellent, well it's a pretty complete business. They do the internal remodeling and what about the external, for example window.
Speaker B (05:03 - 05:39): Everything that is roofing I don't throw it away, I don't do it honestly what is the siting, I do any wall, a part of the house, I'm not going to tell you that I remodel it all. Why? Well, because I tried to do it and when I tried to do it my insurance tells me if it covers you, but your insurance will go up more like handyman. So your insurance already changes is higher, although the numbers are looking good right now, but it is higher and at the same time when you have nothing and you see that it goes down sometimes you will struggle a little because a high insurance has its risks.
Speaker A (05:39 - 05:46): OK, well, then of the exterior that if it comes to be is window door installation, it would be like the silent repair.
Speaker B (05:47 - 05:47): That's right.
Speaker A (05:48 - 05:50): Not the complete installation, but only some.
Speaker B (05:50 - 05:53): Repairs. Repairs, very good.
Speaker A (05:53 - 06:13): So we are going to focus more on what I am seeing, on the interior remodeling, which is what should be more, which is better for you to do. OK, perfect. And currently Mr. Oscar, do you have any method or what method do you use? Rather that question, what method do you use to get new customers? By recommendations.
Speaker B (06:14 - 07:39): Exactly. I even have a page on Yout that honestly, I'm not going to tell you honest, I'm going to be honest with you, don't think it helps me, it doesn't serve me because thank God I tell you, we are accredited and with the years when I worked for someone they called me, so already like the weekends that I didn't work with the boss they would tell me excuse me Oscar, I know it's the weekend, but you know that I got a. Yes you know that the whole floor of the laundry room was raised because the washing machine hose broke. Oscar, can you change this sheetrock And once that I can't give you an insurance because I don't have a business, it doesn't matter. To date, the work you have done here with us, very stable and well done. So call a company, a business, yes, the insurance and everything, but they come with. They do what they want, they do it sometimes reluctantly, if there are people or not, well when the house is alone, so you always this and you are always available. Well yes it sounds bad, but we all use money. Well yeah, it sounds. So to date thank God I tell you, I have not lacked work sometimes even, even I do not answer the calls because I already know the three hours to fifth already up the mountain and they pay me very well, they pay me the lodging and everything but sometimes also my family comes first You understand me?
Speaker A (07:39 - 08:24): No, of course, of course. The family is always first and in fact you have this business for them, you want to give them more time, you want to give them more attention and that they have what is necessary more than necessary. Exactly, the family will always be first. I am always of the same idea that family is always first. Well look Mr. Oscar, we have excellent news. First of all I like it because I'm talking to you, you have a lot of experience, you have the desire, it didn't take you long to say you know what? Well I'm going to put the batteries, I know how to do it, I know how to make the contracts, I have my license in the first year and just last week here in the area where you are and please correct me if I'm wrong, here in Cowell in zip code 83605 Is that correct?
Speaker B (08:24 - 08:25): Yes, yes.
Speaker A (08:25 - 12:36): OK. Just last week we had a total of 1345 searches from people requesting construction and remodeling services. The truth is that there is a lot of work in the area where you are and what you were talking about there is no need to be traveling two hours, more than an hour. These searches that I am telling you Mr. Oscar are happening there in your local area, in your zip code so that you travel twenty, thirty minutes and people are looking for the services. So unlike what you already have because I see Natural Painting and Remodeling effectively in Drills there you have your information and also in MapQuest is practically the same. We unlike these companies, we are not an online directory, what we do is work with Google, we are Google Partners. This means that when people are looking for the services of any service you do, Drywall Painting, Remodeling Services, Bus construction, Cleaning or any other service, people will be able to know your business, Google will recommend your business and you will appear in front of those interested customers near your local area so you can get a better idea. Mr. Oscar, if we search right now Remodeling Services there in your local area you can search Remodeling Services to see what your competition is. Ethical remodeling LLC appears with 5 stars, 54 reviews Terry Construction appears equally with 5 stars, this one has a little more review 75 and there is Treasure Valley Remodeling and Restoration with 4.2 stars and this one has 9 ratings, reviews, sorry. These companies are the ones that appear on the first page of Google and there are more and what we want is that you can also appear on the first page when people look for the services that you can do so we are going to use the keywords the Google algorithm when they are looking for the services will present your business so that is what we want to do Mr. Oscar, that you are in the best place where to be if you have a business that is in Google. Now, what is the first thing we are going to do? The first thing we are going to do to attract the attention of those customers in your local area is going to be a professional website I would like you to see first of course Mr. Oscar how professional we are and how the design of the website can be for your business Look, I sent you a text message with a link that says Locals starts if you click on that link appears the design of the website and this is something that I just did right now in a couple of minutes more or less with information that you gave me of the services that you do we can change the design, put your own photos or videos in fact it would be important so that people can see in detail the quality of your work, that can be convinced and we put the name of your business What do you think of the design of the page sir? If you want you can put me Speaker so we continue talking while you see it OK, so we will put for example there the services, we put service 1, drywall services, service 2, painting services, remodeling kitchens, bathrooms, h. We will focus primarily on those that better remunerate without leaving aside Insulation, Window installation, Siding Repair but we will focus on the projects that better remunerate Mr. Oscar OK, perfect. Now, unlike Yelp or any other lead generator we do not sell leads, we do not charge any commission either very well, you can receive 20, 30 or more calls a month and you do not have to be paying for each of those customers who call you, in fact customers will call you directly, we are not intermediaries. Your phone number appears when people are interested in the services in any of the advertising services that we are going to do with that they click on your phone number will be linked the call directly to you or to you Mr. Oscar, there with you negotiate types of work, the costs, when they can start the project, everything necessary to the project that your customers need OK? Any questions up to this point Mr. Oscar?
Speaker C (12:36 - 12:38): No ma'am, can you hear me well?
Speaker A (12:38 - 14:27): Perfect, very good. Now Mr. Oscar, how effective are we going to be unlike Yelp? Well we are going to put it in a very simple way. We use Google more, we use Google every day and we don't use it so much and to search Right? So when people are searching on Google, Google is going to recommend it, it puts your business on the first page of Google and this is a complete service, this is not only a website, the website is one of the tools that we use. We put your own domain as W naturaltinkingandremodeling. Com At the level of large companies we put a business in the 50 directories equally most important in your local area Super Pages, Yellow Pages, Yahoo Business, mapquest, thumbtech and more. What we want is to make sure that you have a constant flow of potential customers who need services and who are willing to pay well for their work, OK? And that you don't have to be going to 2 hours 20, 30 minutes, there is a lot of work there where you are. We create your official listing in Google My Business and Google Maps so Google will already recommend you and we will cover all these guidelines that Google asks and so we make sure that every day people who are looking for your services will be easy to find them. Very well, so that is how we work. Now we are going to be realistic also we want to know what is the capacity that you can take of these 1,345 searches that I am telling you and we have to be realistic, maybe not all go with you. Let's assume, because there are many companies on the first page, assuming that at least 10% is a fairly real number, we are talking about 12 to 13. If you receive 12 to 13 calls Mr. Oscar a week, how many of them could you do the work for?
Speaker C (14:27 - 14:28): Well look, being honest.
Speaker B (14:31 - 14:31): More than anything.
Speaker C (14:31 - 15:29): I have an accountant and I work. I don't think I just spend my time like some people who have their business; they already have a business and just stay at home. I'm working; I spray, I prepare, I do everything, and sometimes I don't have time to check my SketchUp. So, she's the one who calls me, ""Today is the 12th, by Monday the 16th, there has to be a house and it's from this date to that date, OK, everything is ready, you have to get it done."" I never wait. The company whose materials I like, I go get them because waiting is a waste of time. I do my SketchUp with the people and everything and I get moving, so she's reminding me all the time. So, I would have to see, because if I answer people right now, no, I can handle 5 clients, and then they call you, ""Hey, you messed up, what happened?""
Speaker A (15:32 - 16:59): And that also matters a lot for the valuation they're going to give your business, that you commit, that you're responsible. Now, look, Mr. Oscar, let's think about it this way. As you're telling me, assuming it's one, at least one, because you've been doing well, because you have your schedule well organized, assuming you could only do one, I think, and that would be approximately like 4 a month on average. I think if you at least do these four projects in any case, we would be helping to grow your business. Very good. And Mr. Oscar, the cost for this complete online service, which is your website, your own domain W Natural Thinking and Remodeling, your business in the 50 most important directories, your business in an official listing on Google My Business and Google Maps, so that Google will recommend your business, this has a monthly cost of only $363.99 a month. I think if we achieve that goal at a minimum, I mean, in a worst-case scenario it could be more, obviously, and what we want is for your business to grow, but I think if we manage to make these clients interested in your services and have a constant flow of potential clients, it would be easy for you to pay these 363 dollars and 99 cents, right?
Speaker B (17:01 - 17:03): It has a monthly cost, it would be a cost.
Speaker A (17:03 - 17:28): Consecutive monthly 363 dollars and 99 cents. That's right, month to month, and effectively Mr. Oscar, it's a month to month services, which means that if you see that we are effectively making your business grow, that people are calling you and, most importantly, that you are making money thanks to that exposure, the only thing you will want is to continue with the service, right?
Speaker B (17:28 - 17:41): Yes, of course. I understand what you're telling me, everything you're telling me, of course I understand it. But here's the thing. I say it with all due respect so that no one is offended, because apart from you, different ones have spoken to me.
Speaker A (17:42 - 17:44): This era everyone gets offended.
Speaker B (17:45 - 17:59): Exactly, exactly. Exactly. So not an offer. No, no, no, I don't know what to call it. Well, yes, okay, the offer is not expensive, honestly it's not expensive because you spend more on nonsense, honestly.
Speaker C (18:00 - 18:01): But there it goes.
Speaker B (18:01 - 18:28): Giving me a commitment for. Because I know my business very well, thank you. I am sane, regular. To commit myself and not fulfill it, I don't like. I don't like it. Why? Because until now, thank God, I say again, we are busy. Since I started my business, we are busy. I tell you again, there are times when I don't answer the calls and it looks a little bad, rude, but in my land we are like that, he who grabs too much, holds little.
Speaker A (18:28 - 18:29): Yes, that's correct.
Speaker B (18:29 - 18:36): You understand? So, why am I going to make a commitment if I'm not going to fulfill it later? OK, because later on.
Speaker A (18:38 - 19:25): This is where many people get a little confused, Mr. Oscar, because that service is not designed to overload your business with clients. The service that we are offering is for you to choose the clients that best remunerate you. It's so you don't have to be traveling far, Mr. Oscar. Now, in any case, what it means to have a professional website and put your business online, that already gives your business an additional value, that people can already know your projects, that people already begin to recognize your name. Because effectively, Mr. Oscar, there is a big difference between companies looking for clients or clients looking for the company.
Speaker B (19:25 - 21:05): That's right, you're very right. I'm going to understand you very well there. And I go back to the same thing, I'm very interested because as I say, I've been spoken to apart from different apps or something like that, I don't know what to call them. And if I quickly talk to my accountant, ""You know what? Look, these people spoke to me and like this, like that,"" she communicates with the people, just like with you, she asks for more information, everything that goes, what it is based on. Then she tells me ""Oscar, they are not asking for much, but as you just said, they are giving you, they are opening a door for you to grow more. Are you capable of growing more? Well, if you already have more sprayers, well to date no, you're the one who sprays, are you going to hire more personnel, more expenses, more payroll, more insurance, are you capable of all that?"" And right now no, because I only have one year. So once you believe, when you say, ""I currently have three people and I four and the two girls that clean the houses that I have."" When you already have a bigger business, immediately you and give me the order and I communicate with those who call us and we see which one suits us best. And absolutely, enough to grow and not only here in the State of areas, you can move to Utah, you can move further up, even all the contractors with whom you have worked come from Montana, come from Utah, come from other states, from Wisconsin, come from Washington and they say, they enter calls or messages or emails, they say ""Hey natural pa, we have a project here in some buildings in Utah that is young, is paying hotel, is paying all that."" Are you prepared for that? Honestly, so, so much so no. So at least the vision does not remain.
Speaker A (21:05 - 22:47): That OK, businesses, there is no business that is a success, that has success as we want to see your business, no Amazon, or Facebook, or Tesla, or anyone in a year, I don't know how to say all that. So, look Mr. Oscar, the truth is that this is a process, it's not something that's going to happen overnight, don't think that if you do it, you're going to start being on Google tomorrow. We have to go through a validation process. Google needs to verify your business, that you effectively have your license, your registrations, that you effectively do the remodeling services, we have to put all those records in the directories. So this is also a process Mr. Oscar, it's not something that happens overnight, no? Yes, of course, we are also going to grow at your pace Mr. Oscar. Very good, because this is like any other social network, not because someone has a, a page on Facebook or on Instagram, it means that they are going to go viral immediately, that they are going to have thousands of likes, it doesn't work like that. So, Mr. Oscar, what we want is to start this process that within a year we are going to increase all these visibilities, OK? In fact, look, I'm going to send you the projection that we have for your business right now. So, in the first month we are going to build all the advertising material. At the beginning we are going to gain momentum and we are going to gain confidence with Google. There in the link that I just sent you, did you receive it, it's a bar, well, it's a graph.
Speaker B (22:48 - 22:49): What is your name, sorry?
Speaker A (22:49 - 22:51): Oscar, like you.
Speaker B (22:51 - 22:57): Oscar, give me a second, brother, I'm going. I have to talk to the Sacramento gafas.
Speaker A (22:57 - 22:58): OK, I'll wait here. OK.

Well, let me introduce myself again, Jamie. My name is Ismael, I'm a manager of my company that is 411 locals. And the reason that I asked my assistant to contact with you is because, well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does a remodeling service on the area because there's a great increase on the demand of customers looking for the service as you do. So what I would like to do on this way, Jamie, is that we can just work together and I can be able to put you in front of all of these customers so that this will be as much beneficial. Just to make you know, there are uh more than 1500 customers looking for this service on the area. And imagine if we can be useful for all of them, that will be as much beneficial, right? Okay. Now, please tell me on this way, Jamie, uh for how long have you been running this business on your own? It's going to be four years already. Four years from now. Wow, then you can get a lead for that, Jamie, because normally most of the people didn't pass from their first three or six months, but uh four years in business is looking great about the service you do. Now on these uh four years, Jamie, tell me, the way that you manage to get new customers for you or the way the new prospects can be able to find you, how you do it on that way? By the recommendations, word of mouth, you have your business cards, uh your flyers, you have your website. Uh tell me how you do it. By recommendation. Mostly recommendations. And you don't do like nothing on social media or something like that? No, absolutely not. The thing is everything is sold out for today. And I get tile, I'm still waiting on tile. I don't have anything at the last TG. Oh, okay. I can let the salesperson know. Okay, give me a second. Uh-huh. I can let the salesperson know if we get it in tomorrow, but I I have not today. Okay. Yeah. Okay, no problem. Yeah. Hello, sorry. I was with the first. No, no, sorry. I understand, don't worry. I know that you you can be like that way, but thank you also for giving me some time. So um what I was uh saying it on this way and then um Jamie so that uh if you can tell me for an example, when it's talking about the services um what are the ones that you prefer the most uh to do? Residential, commercial, or you can do both without any preference specific? I do both, I don't have preference. Okay. I I do both. Yeah, yeah, I know, that's great. The thing is that, you know, sometimes some people have like a little bit preference, maybe for uh residential, because uh when it talks about commercial, there's a good money on there and and things like that. But uh unfortunately, the money takes a little bit more to come to you, know? Because you they need to do some diligence, they need to check with the accounting, they need to check with everything else, know? And then it takes a little bit more to bring you to the money payment. But now, it's good then to know that uh you can do both without any inconvenience. Now, going on this way, um tell me then uh when it comes about service, have you been trying any time to do like any online for your business? For an example, social media, uh I don't know, you have tried to get like a website for your business, something like that? Or you never done that? Uh I tried a couple times. Uh I used to have like a AngelList. Oh. And didn't work work out very good. So they were sending me pay pay leads. And I stopped doing that. So yeah, I'm not very, I wasn't very happy with that. Yeah, I know. And also with the with that company, you shouldn't be happy any time. Because well, we have that a company, like one of the companies that instead of helping people is taking just money and uh not getting any help for the customers, right? I think that maybe that's the thing that happens to you. Yeah, they were uh making me lose time and money, so I stopped using them. And money. Yeah, because the thing is that they sell you the leads, but also, just to be honest, there are fake leads, because I have a from one of my customers that he has he told me that he received a call uh on that way so that uh he was uh getting, no, like a customer that, ""Hey, I want this job to be help from me. This is a big job, a good job."" And this guy was like excited, no, to get a good uh job. And then he and then the the guy says, ""Just let me call you in a few seconds because I'm a little bit busy, but I want this job to be done."" And that's and that happens, no? So then he takes a day, the second day, didn't call this guy. When he was turning turning back the call, this guy didn't answer and he said like, ""Well, maybe this job will not be done."" Then like in the third or fourth day, he received again that call and he was looking his phone and he said, ""Hey, this is this guy, so the job is going to be done."" And you know, then when he received the call, he was saying, ""Hey, this is uh Marcus for AngelList because we want you to get a better package for your service so that your business will be better."" And he was like, ""Hey, this is the guy that told me that he wants a job, no?"" And then he realized, well, that they were like faking leads. Their own employees were calling him and they are charging for calls that their employees were doing, no? So that was like a completely bad thing, no? Yeah, correct. Yeah, yeah. But also, let me tell you on this way, uh the thing is and and and also the reason that I ask you for this, is because well, uh the way that we want to work with you is that we always base our service based in numbers, in the facts, and the benefits that you will be looking always directly by yourself uh before you being doing any kind of payment with us. So let's uh also, I'm not going to charge you per lead, I'm not going to ask for any commission, any percentage, any amount per job or per project, because the way that we want to do is that you, as you mentioned at the beginning, that you have as much jobs as possible. That will help you to grow and, of course, succeed. And then happy with the service, so if you grow, we grow directly with you on the way that you're going to be happy with this, because my service is a post-paid service. And that means that at the moment that you're doing a payment, is because you're you're paying for the service rendered on the month before. So for an example, if we activate your service today, your first monthly payment, it will be until December the 22nd. So on that way that you will be looking in real time by yourself everything that we are creating, everything that we are doing, and the benefits that this is giving you on real time. And then, of course, happy with the service, when it comes the December the 22nd, you can do your monthly payment, happy with the service that you'll receive, no? Instead of making just leads and not getting nothing, and if the lead comes, that's good, but if not, I will charge for the leads, right? So we are not going to charge you anyway for that, because we want you to get as much jobs as possible. And then that this will be paying directly by itself, no? That you will see that the constant flow of work and the income that you're getting is giving you to that this will be paying directly by itself, right? Okay, so how much is to start? Okay, right now, just for the to activate your service, it's only a one-time charge of $49.99. This is just a one-time charge that we are asking for the 1% of your trust on the way that you can let us show you how we gain the additional percent from you and that you will be facing, as we said, in numbers, in the facts, and the benefits that you're getting. And then on that way, happy with the service, we can continue working as much as much possible. And then on your until the next uh December the 22nd, you will be having uh monthly fee that it will be a fixed rate. That means that it won't change any time. And then also right now we are giving you uh a special offer that is a limited time for your area that is only for $202.99 and that will be every month uh for a fixed rate that you will be getting. And that will be every 16th, sorry, every 22nd of every month. And then on a post-paid service that as we said, means that you will be paying for the service rendered to you on the month before. So it's like paying a month in delay, right? Okay, where are you guys located? So, uh as I mentioned you, my service uh and my company name is 411 locals so that we are on your local area working. And all the the jobs that you will be getting are on your local area. And then we are on the one-on-one on the main Avenue on the second floor for the Commission Center directly. And then on this way so that we can bring you all the jobs on your local area that you don't need to do like long distance between a job and the other, because that way the way that we work as my name of my company is 411 locals, that we start from your local area and then we can expand to any place you want. Okay. And you think we can uh make a meeting, maybe to meet up and start uh like you can explain me better. Uh so you want to do go to the office or something? Is what you want to do? Yeah, if that's possible. Yes, if you want, I can send you the uh the address and then uh if you can tell me when we can or you're going to go so that you can verify on the service.

This part here. Okay. And yeah, by the way, Noah, I have my manager here, Raven. We have Noah under lawn care service. Five years in the business and he don't have a website. Um, thanks. Hey, Noah, how's it going? Uh, pretty good. How's yours? I'm glad to hear that. I'm doing great, thanks for asking. And I thank you for taking my call. I did ask my assistant to contact you because we are looking for a reliable business
that we can work with in your area. And I would like to ask a few questions first, to see if this would be a good fit. Um, what kind of jobs do you usually take on? Um, just like mowing, and then weed eating, uh, uh, pulling weeds, everything like that, raking leaves, everything. Okay. Um, but do you have a preferred job or it doesn't matter? Um, it really doesn't matter. Okay, that's what I'm trying to get to Josh, right? Okay. Um, and uh, how far can you travel for a job? Uh, about 20 miles. 20 miles radius. Okay. What was the code are you based at? 83501. 83501. Okay. Um, Okay, and you've been doing this for five years now, right? Yeah. Okay. Um, well, I'm pretty sure you know what you're doing since you've been in the business that long. Uh, but so how do you normally get new clients? Um, just through our Facebook ads, and then we post through the Lewis and Tribune, which is, I don't know if you guys are from Lewis and Idaho, but, uh, it's just like a news article and then you just get newspapers every week.

Okay. Uh, paper lead, did you say? What? Uh, did you say paper lead? Sorry, you you cut off a little bit right there. Uh, like newspapers, we get uh, we put ads in the newspapers. Oh. Um, okay, that's good. Uh, how much are you paying for that? Um, it's just a small amount, so like $20. Per, is that per week or every day? How does that work? Uh, uh, we just choose what weeks we want to put it in and then they're, they size it by like inch, uh, for like the paper. So every inch is like a certain amount of dollars. Oh, got you. Okay. Um, well, look, my company is Fully Local. Um, we monitor the traffic of search terms on the internet, and we're actually seeing an increase in demand for your service. There are 5,426 customers looking for your service. And uh, if I put you in front of those people, um, that would be beneficial for your business, right? Yeah. Uh, let me ask you this first. Do you know, um, Sheena landscaping? Uh, no. How about, uh, Midlock Lawn, uh, and landscaping? Uh, no. Um, or maybe Davis lawn care? Uh, I've, think I've heard of it. Okay. Um, well, look, you see those guys, even though the name doesn't really ring a bell, right? I mean, I'll steer to reverse lawn care, right? But they are the ones getting those customers that I was talking about, because how it works, whenever a customer would search for, you know, lawn care or landscaping, those business names pops up on the first page of Google. Uh, sadly your company's not there yet, right? But I want to change that. I mean, I want you to get those phone calls and uh, I want you to get those customers, right? Um, how about a website? Do you already have a website? Not yet? Uh, no. Okay, well, not a problem. But are you planning on building a website? Um, not really. Okay, well, because you know, you do landscaping or lawn care, right? That really suits for your business. You need to be able to show something to your customers before they do business with you. Um, does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, well, look, based on what you told me, I think this would be a good fit. Um, so here's what we're going to do for you to get those customers. First, we're going to put you on Google, okay? We make sure that when a customer would search for any of the services that you offer, you come up on the first page of Google, right? So you get those calls directly instead of us, okay? Second, we're going to create you a sample website. I mean, a website, okay? Um, in fact, as we speak, I'm actually creating you a sample website. Um, I'm going to send this to you via text, okay? Um, but let me uh, confirm the company name. What's the company name? HB lawn care. H like Henry and then B like Bravo, lawn care? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Lawn care. Now, I'm going to send this to you via text. Um, you should be getting that any moment now. Um, you do also landscaping, right? Yeah. Okay. Um, did you get it? Uh, not yet. Should be there now. Uh, yeah, I got it. Okay. Let me know if you got it pulled up. Oh, yeah, I got it. Okay. Um, pretty cool how fast I did that, huh? Yeah. Okay. You see your company name, right? HB lawn care. Yeah. Okay. It has your phone number, um, the location, right? Um, Yeah. But this website can be customized, right? Like whatever you want your customers to see, we can make that happen, uh, for you. Like from the color of the website, um, layout, content, anything that you want your customers to see. So we can do that for you, okay? Now, the beauty of this website, um, is we make sure that it will generate traffic. So it is designed to flow seamlessly connect with Google, because, you know, this is what we, uh, common mistakes that we see from business owners, right? They get a, they get a business card, but the problem is, the thing is they're not handing them over. So it's pointless, it's not going to do anything for you, right? If you don't hand them over. So same thing with the website. We make sure that the website will generate traffic because no matter how beautiful the website is, but if nobody's looking at it, then it's not going to be any good, right? Yeah. So we make sure it will generate traffic, okay? Um, now, we've discussed the uh, Google placement, right? And uh, website. Now, third, we're going to be listing your business to over 50 online directories, right? I believe you know those places like Yelp, Manta, super pages, white pages, merchant circle, um, let me just name a few because again, there are 50 online directories that we will be listing you in, right? So that no matter where they search online, they will always find you. Okay? Yeah. Now, going back to your services, right? Um, like how much do you make off for an average job? Uh, like $50 to $75. $50 to $75. And how long does it take you, uh, take you to finish the job? Let's say for $75. Um, about an hour. Okay, no shop. An hour or so, is that what you said? Yeah. Okay. Um, because again, we're, we're looking at 5,220, uh, 241 searches, right? Now, say I send you 80 of those in a month, like how many do you think you can do business with? Um, probably in a month, uh, probably about, half, maybe more than half. More than half. So, okay, just to be realistic with the numbers, so let's say 30 to 35, right? Let's go 30, right? Yeah. Um, so, but this is just an average, right? So the charge of your, um, service is $75, multiplied by, uh, say 35, that makes you $2,625 off the jobs that I send you, right? Um, now, even if I, even if I charge you $500, I mean, you're not going to be mad at me at that, right? Nope. Nope, that's right. All right. Of course. Um, I'm not going to ask you $500, okay? The maintenance fee for our service is only going to be $182.99. Uh, we don't have to get them to pay that up front, okay? That's 30 days from today. Uh, after your billing cycle will be every third of the month, so that will start December, um, third, automatically. Now, today, believe it or not, for us to get started, it's only $25.99. With absolutely no contract. That is correct. So 25.99 just to show, start showing you results, right? Show you how we get helping grow your business. Um, you like what you're getting, you like what you're seeing, right? Um, so that's going to be $182.99. Now, regardless, if you get 5, 10, 20, 30, uh, 40 or even 100 customers, that is all yours. We're not going to ask you any commissions or percentage. How does that sound to you? Pretty good. Pretty good. Okay. Now, look, so, um, for sure you're going to ask me like, okay, Raven, if I were to do this, how would I know if the customers that I'm getting are actually coming from you guys, right? So we came up with this feature. We called it 411 connect, okay? What it does is, it's going to screen the calls for you, okay? So you'll have, or we will assign you, um, a different local number, um, and it's going to route to your phone, okay? So say for example, somebody found you on the front page of Google or maybe from the marketing website or maybe from those online directories that we listed you in. Before you answer the phone call, somebody from our team will do that for you, okay? If it's a telemarketing call, and for sure you don't want those, right? Then we're going to block those numbers. But if it's someone that is ready to spend their money for a service, then that person from our team will transfer the call straight to you. And if you're not able to pick up your phone, you will receive a text message or an email containing the information from that customer. So no leads will be wasted. And guess what? I'll give that to you as a trial for the first 30 days, for you to track the results of our program on a daily basis. How's that sound to you? Perfect. Okay. Now, after 30 days, right? It will automatically opt out, right? So you don't have to call us to cancel that, right? So it's the other way around. If you wish to continue using that service, um, you have to call us, okay? Oh. Okay. Now, um, if you don't have any questions, I can hold the spot for you. I just need to ask basic information about the company. Um, is this the best number for customers to contact you? Uh, yes, sir. Okay, and the name of the company, uh, that's HB lawn care, right? Is this an LLC or? Yeah. No, no, no LLC. Okay. Um, and then do you have an email address where your customers can maybe send you a future appointment or a thank you note? Uh, yeah. Go for it. Noah, Bka, B l i m k a, 21@gmail.com. I'm Sorry, it's cut you off. Can you repeat that? So that's Noah and then? Bka, B l i m k a. m k a. Okay. 21.gmail.com, right? @gmail. Oh, Gmail, okay. Thank you. Um, so your first name is Noah, correct? Yeah. And your last name is Bka, B l i n k a, like Alpha. Yeah. Right? Okay, thank you. Now, um, give me at least five of the services that make you the most money. Um, mowing grass. Weed eating. Okay. Weed pulling. Huh? Uh, leaf picking. Oh, okay. Landscaping at least. Mhm. Or like leaf removal, right? Yeah. Okay. What else? And then bush trimming. Bush trimming. Um, do you want me to add landscaping as well? Uh, yeah. Okay. Um, now, which address did you register this business? It doesn't have to be a business address. Uh, could be a home address, right? Uh, because Google will verify your business, right? They're either going to send you a verification code through your mail or a video verification. It's 1227 Alder avenue. Alder avenue. Um, Lewiston, Idaho, 83501. Yes, sir. Um, is there, is there a trailer number on this one or? Um, so it's not a trailer, it's a house, but it's in a trailer park, and it's Oh. Okay, got you. It's 12. So 1227, right? 1227. Yeah. Okay. Um, who is Josh Ketchup Castle? Josh Ketchup Castle? Uh-huh. Uh, I'm pretty sure that's the one who used to live. I'm not sure though. Oh, okay, but you're the owner now to this address. Okay. Um, because I see a listing of Josh, Josh Ketchup Castle, um, registered to this address, right? But let me see. All right. Verified. Um, Okay, nope, it's not verified, so we can definitely, definitely take over this listing and, um, um, use it for your business. Okay. Now, um, what's your days and hours of operation? What? Your days and hours of operation. Not quite a lot. Um, Monday through Saturday. Mhm. And then two to seven. Two to seven. Two to seven. Okay. Um, so you have like a full-time, uh, uh, job during the morning time or? Um, yeah, I got another job. Oh, wow. Nice. Okay. But are you pursuing this to, I mean, do this like full-time?

Sure, thank you. Hey Jayden, good morning. How are you? Good, how are you? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you so much for asking. Well, Jayden, this is Cora Johnson. I did ask my assistant Greg to call you because we're currently looking for a reliable business that we can actually work with for construction in the local area. So, uh that's the reason why we did call you because there's a lot of people looking for your services right now. And we're looking to partner up with a reliable business to actually feature in front of those interested people searching online. So I just wanted to ask you a few questions, that way we could see if this might be a good fit. Would that be okay? Okay. Yes, yes. Thank you. Uh Jayden, can you please tell me more about West Construction, like how long have you been running the business now? And what kind of jobs do you usually want more of that can make you the most money? Uh, been in business 11 years and full house builds, full remodels, anything to do with construction and somebody's home, we do. I see, I see. Are you also catering out like commercial or commercial jobs as well? Or just mainly residential? Mainly residential, but I've done some commercial jobs. They just don't come around as often as residential does. Okay. Not a problem then. Thank you. And so far, how far are you willing to travel for jobs? Or how many mile radius are we looking at? Let's say 200 miles. Oh wow! Congratulations. So pretty much you can travel where the money is, right? Yeah. Yeah, if the doll pays for it, we're there. Right, exactly. And so far so good. I'm just curious to know like how do most of your customers usually find you? Um is it online, word of mouth, referrals? Word of mouth. I see, I see. But the business is located in what zip code again? 83525. 83525. Got it here. And so far, you're still open to take on more customers, right? Oh yeah. Right. Well, the reason why I did ask you that question is because our company is actually the one who specialize in monitors the online traffic search of people who are currently are looking and searching for your services, specifically for full remodel. And actually in the past 30 days alone, there is already a total of 13 total monthly search for a reliable construction and remodeling business like yours. So if I could put your business in front of these interested people searching and looking for your services, that would be something very, very beneficial, right? Yeah. Right. Now here, here's what we do. Uh, so you would have a better understanding. When people search online for full house remodel or remodeling services in the city of Elk City, they usually don't type in a business name, right? They just search for the service that they needed. Like full house remodeler near me or full house build remodel here in Elk City, Idaho. And if you're not showing up in front of those customers, Yeah. your competitors are getting those phone calls, right? I actually did go to the internet right now and I search for your services. And what I have here is 3R Renovation LLC and then Nolan Construction. Have you ever heard about these people? No. Right. Well, they're actually in Elk City who provides construction and full house remodels as well. And these are actually the ones getting the big checks out of these already interested customer. It's not because they're better, but because they are more visible and it's easier to find coming from those people searching for their your services. Correct. Exactly. And your business Okay. is not even there. You know, the problem is that, you know, even though you are the best option for every customers to found, but if they can find you easily, they will just jump off, right? And that's the reason why we came into place. It's because what we do here at 411 Locals is to make sure that your business shows up in front of those customers so the calls and jobs comes to you instead of someone else. And I believe that that will be beneficial. How much do you guys Okay. What do you charge to take on my business and put it on there? What does it cost? Well, we do have a lot of pricing options that you could actually consider. But again, regarding the prices, we are 80% more affordable than what it would cost you to get this done anywhere else. But give me a few minutes to tell you what we do here differently. If you like what you hear from me then great. If not, then we can always part ways as friends. I just don't want you to misunderstood about yourself, okay? Now, I don't know if you have heard about Sorry to interrupt you. Well, I don't know if you have heard about our company back then, but our company's called 411 Locals. We're actually one of the fastest growing full page advertising companies in the country. We are also a certified Google Partners. I sent you our Google Partner badge on your phone right now on your text message. If you can put me in speaker phone and check that out, that would be great. And we have helped over 70,000 business owners all across the US. I'm not bragging, but these people stay with us, they not because they have to, but because they are getting results. Okay. Great. So we will do the marketing for you. So really all you got to do is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy. Now, to make it simple how we do this is just very simple. The first thing that we will focus or the main thing that we usually do here, that me we focus on is we will be putting your business on the first page placement on Google under five of the main services that you mainly provide. You're using Google, right? Everyday? Yeah. Exactly. And were you able to find exactly. And were you able to find what you're looking for every time on the first page? Fast and quick? Yeah. Exactly. And that's how fast customer will find you once we put you on the first page of Google. They don't need to know about your the name of your business, your phone number, but once they type in a certain keyword that incorporates about your business, we will make sure that your business will be showing up on the first page of Google under five services that makes you the most money. Why in Google? Because 84% of people nowadays are using Google. And here's the kicker. 94% of those people don't even pass the first page results and that is a fact. So once we put you on the first first page of Google, you are naturally going to get calls since people associate the businesses on the first page as being the best anyway. Now, lastly, aside from putting your business on first page of Google, we will also put your business to over 50 online directories that your customers are using right now. We can put you on Yelp, Manta, Merchant Circle, Superpages, Yahoo, Bing, Craigslist, basically all over the internet. If you're paying one of those right now, you don't need to pay them anymore because as part of the program, we guarantee you a full maximal exposure online so that no matter where they search and look for your services, they would be able to find you front and center your competition. Do you have a website right now? Yes. Uh is it the westconstruction. uh oh sorry, westconstructionco.com? Is that right? Yes. Did you created this one? Or you paid someone to create this website for you? My daughter created it. Wow, that's great. She really did a great job. Perfect. And when was the last time you updated the website? And when was the last time you got a customer from the website? Never. On both. Right. Well, basically it's because I love your website, don't get me wrong. But just come to think of this. You may have the best website in the world, but of course if nobody can see it, it doesn't do you any good, right? It's like you're putting a big billboard in the middle of a desert versus you putting a billboard in a road where everyone drives on. So as part of the program itself, we will be creating you a Google optimized website and we will backlink your official website that you have right now so that it will generate more traffic to your website. The more traffic you get, the more customer can find you, the more visible you are, the more jobs that you can make out of that website because a website shouldn't be just a website. It should be a profit generating website at all. Now, out of the services that I just mentioned to you that is part of one package that we offer out of it like uh which one do you think would benefit your business the most right now? Um just getting my name on Google. Exactly. But again, as you can see we use this elements working together to actually help you establish and maintain a strong online presence, which is so critical this day. And it's almost impossible not to make money with this package because remember, we position your business right in front of customers who are already searching for your services. They just don't know who you are, is right? Uh let me ask you, how much do you make for an average job right now? The average cost of your service or the baseline? Yeah, yeah. About the I don't know, anywhere from 5 to 100. 500 to sorry? Uh **** to 100000, 200000, depending. ****. I see. Now, in one month, uh in if it's a $5000 job, how much do you think you could finish in one month? How many jobs do you think you could finish? Uh 5000? Yes. Oh, probably five or six. Yeah, five or six jobs. Okay, five or six. Now, if you made $5000 multiplied by five, that should be making you already $25000, right? So I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be mad at me if you're making $25000 from this exposure we give you plus you get a steady stream of calls calling you every time they need something done. You wouldn't be mad at me. Would you? You know, of course not. Exactly. Have you opened the link that I sent you earlier? I'll click on it right now. Right. And then let me know what do you see on the screen when you open it. Okay. It's not loading. Hang on. All right. It should be the one that says google.com, right? Did you receive it? Yeah. Right. Yes. So, what do you have you opened it already? It's uh not loading. Uh no good internet. Okay. Not a problem. Would you would you be able to check uh check a picture without internet? Oh, there it's going. Okay. Google partner. Yeah, I see that Google partner. Right. I see it now. Now, I want Okay. Once you check that uh I want you to check on the link that you clicked in. It's not coming from our official website. It's directly coming from google.com, right? I'm showing you our Google Partner badge um because I wanted you to understand that we have met our um our requirements to be a certified Google Partner and we have maintained in our optimization score of at least 70% indicating that we have set up our clients to perform well. Now, I'm showing you this, Jayden, because I want you to understand that Google would not associate themselves with just anyone. A multi-billion dollar company. Sorry? That's good to know. Yeah, that's good to know. You guys do your job. Right. And of course, a multi-billion dollar company will never ever compromise their reputation by being partners with a non-legit company, correct? And also from 900 SEO company around the US, only five were given the badge and we are proud to say that we know exactly how to help you and your business in getting the right exposure you need that will also help you generate the right clients for your business. So we will do the marketing for you. So really all you got to do is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy. I'm pretty sure that is something that you can do, correct? Yep, that's what I do. Uh-huh. Right. Absolutely. Now, exactly. So pretty much now, let me go down to prices so you would understand how we are working with that, okay? Now, the uh the zip code of the business, just want to make sure I give you the right uh promotion right now since it's it's almost Thanksgiving day. It's 83525, correct? Okay. Yes. All right. Now, normally to start this whole package deal that we are currently running for you, it should be around $700. But we are currently running a promotion since it's almost Thanksgiving day. So to get everything started, it's only going to be $59.98 to set it up today. You will be on the first page of Google. You will have your own website and we will list your business to over 50 online directories. Are you following? Yeah. Right. Now after 30 days, regardless how much you're making or regardless how many jobs you get, it's all yours. We're not going to be asking for any cuts or any commission. But for you to maintain the program every month, it's only going to be a flat rate of $302.98. But then again, I'm not going to ask you to Sorry? 302 a month? Right. $302.98 flat rate. But then again, I'm not going to ask you to pay that today. That's 30 days from today. To be exact, your billing cycle will be every day 26th of every month and it will be auto build as your monthly recurring fee. But again, today, believe it or not, since it's almost Thanksgiving day, I'm going to give you a good promotion. To get everything started today, it's only going to be $59.98. Now, that's a really great start on investment, right? And and then 300 a month after after the one month. Exactly. Yes, that is correct, sir. $302.98. It's a month to month service. It's a performance based campaign. So this is what I'm going to be asking from you. As long as the program is paying for itself, you get enough money to keep in your pocket, then all I'm going to be asking from you is just to simply stay in our company. Is that fair enough? I understand. Yeah, let me uh I need to um I need to get with my daughter and get my my uh website beefed up. I'm not ready to say yes right now because I want to make sure I'm I'm ready to go on the internet. Yeah, of course, not a problem. I'm going to talk to my daughter and run it by my wife. She's my secretary and do is there a phone number I can call you back to talk to you? So Yeah, you can always call me back. That's not going to be a problem. But when can we follow up with you? Because we want to get you on board with us as much as early as possible because uh listing on the first page uh actually is uh blood war, you know? They wanted to always be on the. Yeah, oh yeah.

I'm going to send you our cell phone number and I'm going to send you also my direct uh name and my extension number for so that when you call, you can always look for me Cora Johnson. But um in a scale of 1 to 10, how likely you would like to proceed with this program today? I would say eight. Feel pretty about it. I want to do a little research and do my uh due diligence to make sure it's worth worth uh the money because if I'm putting crap up there, I don't want that. I want it to be good. So I'm not Right, exactly. I see, I see. And I feel like it's probably Yeah, it's pretty good. Exactly. Uh-huh. I already sent you another link to your phone, sir. Uh could you please open that one for me? It says customer success stories. Can you please open it? Yeah. Uh, I got the wrong one. Okay. Yeah, I see. Right. What do you see on the screen, sir? Is it SLK or is it e-farming or No, it should be customer success stories. Okay. I just sent you the one that says 411 locals uh.com/customer success stories. I just texted it to you. Okay. Oh, I see. Yeah, can you open it for me, please, Jayden? Yeah, you're sending like three messages and try to figure out. None of them say customer success. You didn't? Okay, let me it should be a link. Yeah, let me send it again to you. Yeah. There. Okay, there I got it now. Right. Can you open it for me and then let me know what do you see on the screen? Success stories, yeah. Right. Can you scroll down and then once you once you find the one that says Cleaning All with the client info, let me know. Cleaning All? Yep. And the success stories? Yeah, can you scroll down until you find the one that says Cleaning All in Champagne, Illinois. Yeah, I see it. Right. Now, you see there Cleaning All, cleaning service in Champagne, Illinois, correct? Yes. Right. I want you to go to Google and I want you to type in cleaning services in Champagne, Illinois. Don't touch with Cleaning All. Just type in cleaning services in Champagne, Illinois. And then let me know what do you see on the field for businesses. Okay. Go to Google and type in cleaning service in Champagne, Illinois. Okay. Oh, you got it? Yeah, neighborhood cleaning company, Clean by Libby. There's up two. I'm sorry. The the top two picks are cleaning by Libby and neighborhood cleaning. I see. I think that's the sponsored one. Can you click on the businesses? Yeah, the businesses. Yeah, the businesses. Oh yeah. What do you see? Uh, I don't see it. Oh, sponsor oh so go down. Yeah, the businesses because the sponsored one are actually the one that you that that are paying Google Ads. We're looking for the organic listing and the local listing. Go to the businesses. Cleaning Cleaning All, is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah, is that the one? The name that you see on the success stories? Right. Yeah. Now, I'm showing you this in particular because I want you to have it firsthand that even though you're not putting the name of the business, if once you put a certain keyword on Google, you can see they're already Cleaning All. That's one of the companies that we have been helping for almost almost so many years now. And I'm showing you this not to brag, but I'm showing you this that obviously that $59.98 that I'm offering you right now will not get us paid here, right? That $59 $59.98 is simply to open your doors between your company and mine so we can start proving our worth to your business. Now, I know you mentioned to me earlier that you're not yet ready with that, but it's just that, you know, putting your business on the first page of Google is not an emergency button, right? It is a process that needs to be taken care of so that while you're building your business online or building everything for your business, we are already starting to get your name out there so that we can already start building your solid foundation for your business, right? Now, this services that we are providing to your for your business, sir, is actually to give you um to give you that maximum exposure online so that no matter where the customers search and look for your services, they would be able to find what your services are, okay?

Now, if there is one thing I can assure you is that we won't leave you behind here. You have your team that will work with you exclusively with your account because I won't be giving you this for only $59.98 if we are not confident that we can provide you this maximum online exposure you need for your business. Let's have a deal here, Jayden. Okay. Take advantage of the $59.98 right now that I'm offering you. If I won't keep up with the expectation that I've told you, just give me a call and let's have another one on one talk today. How about that? Fair enough? Okay.

Okay. I talk to my wife before I want my wife to know what I'm going to do because I I that's what I do. I talk to her. So I want her to see and I got your website pulled up and reviews and everything. And I want to make sure I uh you know, I don't say yes unless my wife agrees. Yeah, of course. Not a problem because you know it's like it's like a deal. The other down going in the winter time and the business. Right, exactly, exactly.

I'll call you back. I'll do the talking to her. I'll call you back, okay? Uh sure. Not a problem. Uh you can put me in hold, though. I can wait for you. Oh, it'll take a while.

I'll just go ahead and send you also the full information on your text message so you could also show it to your wife as well, okay? I'll stick with you later then. Yes, I got your uh Cora. Your name is Cora? Yep. Cora Johnson? Yep. I got it. Okay, thank you. I'll get off the phone. Okay, then. Okay. Bye-bye. You have been kicked from this conference. Kind of a mute, sorry. YSTL. Yun yung issue di ba. So yung opening mo ganito. Hey, it's calling you back cuz I see that uh there's a misunderstanding uh between you and the account manager. Um so I'm here to sort that out. Um for the maximum um results for you to to see the full benefits or impact of this marketing campaign is 7 to 8 months. Tama ba yung time frame? 7 to 8 months pa ba? 2 to 6 months, TL. O, 2 to 6 months. And that's the maximum result 2 to 6 months. For your area, since it's most area, right? Um so sorry, before that. So but this is the process, okay? On your first month, that's really the groundwork. Okay? But you are already visible, but it doesn't mean that you're getting a customer. But since you're already visible, there's a possibility that you're going to start seeing calls. So when we say 2 to 6 months, that's for the maximum result. 2 to 6 months. So on your second month you you're going to start seeing traction. with traction. Third month you're going to start seeing uh traction. Now on your sixth month, we guarantee calls. We guarantee leads, okay? But again, since you're already visible in the first month, that means there's a possibility that you're going to receive a phone. But I'm not going to guarantee you that. It may happen or it may not happen, okay? But one thing for sure, since you're already visible. You got it? That's the concept, pa. First month, you're already visible, there's a possibility. Possibility gamitin mo. Gets mo? YSTL. Ang haba naman sinabi mo. Ah, para ano, ako na yung mag ano, ako na yung mag ano. Ang kailangan mo lang don is maintindihan mo um, test for Darwin like in Leo. Nagka-deal si Darwin ulit? Tang ina ni Darwin, halimaw. Um, so basta dapat ang gusto ko kasi maintindihan mo para ma-explain mo like in your own words. Okay? Pero yung pinaka-importante don is kasi you you uh looking for and to see and to source the result. So wag gagamitin mo yung the first month is really the groundwork. Uh but it doesn't mean you're going to um that doesn't mean that our uh I'm not going to guarantee your customers yet. Since you're already visible, there's a possibility you're going to start seeing um results. You're going to uh receive phone calls. Bawal ko ba sabihin yung na it's almost impossible? Bawal yun. Pwede mo sabihin yung it's almost impossible that you're not going to make money. But like what I said, we guarantee you leads. Okay. Kung ang follow-up natin is 2 to 6 months. Okay. Di ba? Uh-huh. First month pero ii-highlight ko pa rin yung first month na visible na sila. Totoo naman yun. Uh-huh. Uh-huh uh-huh. Pero hindi pa tayo makaka-promise ng phone calls. Pero yung 6 months we can promise it, di ba? Right. Pero i-explain mo sa kanya na yung first month talaga is the groundwork. Um, you're already visible.

No. Um, I I do have a Facebook and Instagram, but I haven't kept it I haven't kept it really active for the most part, because like I said, I I really just enjoy word to mouth.
Okay. Because that that tells me that I'm that I am providing a better a better experience or a better home inspection than what other home inspector home inspectors from my area are doing.
Okay, okay. And I'm asking you this, sir, because you know, well, what people usually do is search now online.
Whenever you have whenever you want something, you know, you you take your phone and start searching for address, location, you know, uh, services and anything.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I just I I need to get out of my, uh, I guess old school ways and and and venture out.
Okay, and I'm telling you this because, um, check I'm just checking in your in your local area, and I see total of 1,836 searches looking for this, uh, home inspection services in your local area. And I'm talking about 50, 60 miles radius. So you don't really have to go, you know, so far to take one of those, uh, projects.
Okay. And that's what we'd like to do with your business. Okay? I'm I'm very sure we can, you know, put in front of your business to some of those customers. That will be something beneficial for your business, right?
Oh, absolutely.
And that's what we'd like to do for your business, okay? Let me let me tell you who we are and what we do, Mr. Aldrich. Our company's 411 locals, sir. We're the biggest company for digital services in US. And what we do is give exposure for your business.
So we watch the traffic for those customers looking online for the type of service that you offer. We Google partners, okay? And we make sure that those customers whenever they're looking for the service for home inspection, they will know your business.
That's what we'd like to do. Okay? How we're going to make that happen, sir? Well, one of the first thing that we're going to do will be build a professional website for your business.
I would like to show you first how professional we are and how the website may looks like. Okay? I I send a text message that says 411locals.com. Did you get it?
Um, let's probably see. Yes.
No, I did.
Okay, perfect. So if you open that link, sir, you will see the website design. Okay? You will you will see how we can, you know, work on your website. And this is something that I'm just build right now.
Okay. The only thing that I'm just create this in a couple of minutes. We can of course, you know, personalize with your own pictures, videos. You choose the color and what we'd like to do is, you know, attach those customers attention whenever they're looking online.
Okay. So, what do you think about the website design, sir?
So it's it's really similar to what I what I already have. I do already have a website built. Um, and like I said, I I'm just I haven't been too active on it on anything. Just because, um, I haven't I haven't pushed to do the home inspections full-time. I still work a full-time job.
So you know, that's. So and and that's that's also kind of why I I've just kind of stuck to word to mouth right now. Just so that I can, you know, still do a do a pretty good work around with my full-time job as well.
Oh, well we're looking at a reliable company at, you know, a commitment company. Well, thank you, sir.

I asked my assistant to call you because we're looking for a reliable business in the area that we can work with.
Now, I'm just going to ask a few quick questions to see if it's going to be a good fit for your company and our company to work together. We'll just want to um, make sure Andrew, so you're only focusing on a snow removal? Or you can also provide other services.
I provide other services.
Like what other services are we talking about, Andrew? You don't mind me asking.
Excavation, road building, site prep, uh custom houses, house foundations, um fire mitigation, force remulching, land clearing, management, trucking, um yeah, you name it.
Perfect. But which one is making you the most money?
All of it.
I love that. It's all making me run out of money the same.
I'm sorry.
I said it's all making me run out of money the same.
Now you accept small, I mean you accept residence.
Go ahead, please. Where do you guys advertise that? Like is this a Facebook thing? Is it meta? Is it platform?
Google. Actually, yeah, it's actually Google.
Oh, this is Google.
Great, great. Not just on Google, but on the first page of Google. So what we provide here is a maximum online exposure and a complete online presence. So the main goal of our program is to make sure that anytime customers would go online when they search or they type in the service, we make sure that it's always you that they'll find. For example, when they type in uh excavating contractor near me.
We make sure that it's you that they'll always find. That way they can reach you directly, they can pay directly.
So how do we do that? So I pay and it gets me bumped to the top of the list.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So I pay and it gets me bumped to the top of the list.
On the first page. Yes, on the first page of Google. And not just that. So first how much is it monthly or yearly?
Well, this is simply month to month. We're going to work hard each month to make sure that you're happy to stay with us. So first thing and foremost, we put your company on the first page of Google under the services you provide and the services that make you the most money and that's what we care. So even if customers don't know you, they don't know your business name, but whenever they search and they type in the services or the keywords, your company automatically pops up. And they will call you naturally because they're going to see you as the best. Now, aside from that,
we also make sure that you have your very own website, Andrew, that is fully optimized and designed to be in the first stage where everyone can see.
So it's going to be a gorgeous website with all the information that you want your customer to see. And it's totally maintenance free, whatever information that you want to add or you want to change, you just have to let us know. And of course, we want to be transparent with you. So we're going to give you your own customer dashboard where you can see and monitor the progress every day and through the customer dashboard, you're going to see there how many customers have called you, how many customers have reached your business through our campaign.
And here's more. For sure, you're quite familiar Andrew with the Yelp, Angie, Super Pages, Manta, you're familiar with those online directories, right?
Yep, yep. But okay, so how much what's your what's your price?
Well, we want to earn your business first. We want to prove to you what we're capable of in terms of helping out your business. So today, I'll give this package to you for only $49.99. And we will start working for you right away. We're not going to be wasting time.
Okay, what's it go to next month?
So, at $49.99 is just a setup fee to get you started. We'll show you how the program works. Now, after a month, on the 22nd of December, to maintain all the services and to maintain everything that we have for you, it will only be a flat rate. A flat rate of $121.99.
Auto $130.
$121.
Okay. That includes the website, the Google listing, Google Maps and Google voice search, online directories and phone book listings. So, simply month to month and that will be a flat rate, Andrew. No matter how many customers you get, no matter how much money you make, the price will never go up. It will never change. That's going to remain a flat rate.
Got you. Okay. Well, that sounds great. I have another call right now coming in. Um, I will think on this. Is this a good number to call back?
It's not.
Can you send me a good number?
Well, are you going to call me back though or are you just trying to brush me off, Andrew?
