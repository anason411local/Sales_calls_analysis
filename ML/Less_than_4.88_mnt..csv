Ah, mucho gusto, Ã‚Â¿okay?
Disculpa molestar seÃƒÂ±orita.
Mira, eh me llamo mi camino con un gerente aquÃƒÂ­ de 411 local seÃƒÂ±orita.
Le habÃƒÂ­a pedido que a la seÃƒÂ±orita que la hablara tambiÃƒÂ©n, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
Porque buscamos un negocio que quisiera tomar mÃƒÂ¡s clientes, este, retomando este, creo que usted habÃƒÂ­a hablado con nosotros ya hace tiempecito, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
Con Samuel.
Hace como algunos meses, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
No se si se acuerda que le habÃƒÂ­amos ofrecido una promociÃƒÂ³n en lÃƒÂ­nea Vanessa para promocionar su compaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­a de limpieza.
Eh eh eh disculpe, eh ahora yo estoy terminando una casa y ya vamos a salir y serÃƒÂ¡ que me puedes volver a llamar maÃƒÂ±ana porque estoy ya acabando la casa para salir.
Ah, con mucho gusto, seÃƒÂ±orita.
Bueno, no mÃƒÂ¡s iba a tardar dos minutos para tomar que la promociÃƒÂ³n que le habÃƒÂ­amos ofrecido, para ver si se recuerda, Ã‚Â¿verdad? la conversaciÃƒÂ³n, si no, pues para no perder su tiempo tampoco, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
Este, tomando en cuenta, seÃƒÂ±orita Vanessa, si si recuerda que le habÃƒÂ­amos ayudado a presentar como una promociÃƒÂ³n para su compaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­a de limpieza tal y cual o realmente no.
Es que ya fue hace tiempo, Ã‚Â¿verdad?

SÃƒÂ­.
Ah, okay.
SÃƒÂ­ cuidado.
SÃƒÂ­, seÃƒÂ±orita, Ã‚Â¿quÃƒÂ© le parece si suena como algo que le fuera a interesar o realmente no tanto, para ya no perder su tiempo?
Este, de hecho, pues eh.
Pero yo creo que por ahora no, porque yo voy a salir de viaje.
Entonces voy a demorar en regresar.
SÃƒÂ­, yo quiero despuÃƒÂ©s de viajar, organizarme bien y todo eso y pues ahora no estoy interesada en eso.
No se preocupe.
Usted va a irse de vacaciones que hay que disfrutar, Ã‚Â¿sÃƒÂ­ o no?
Okay.
Bueno, le dejo, seÃƒÂ±orita, no se preocupe.
Tenga buen dÃƒÂ­a, okay.
CuÃƒÂ­dese mucho, bonito dÃƒÂ­a.

Well, Robert, let me first of all introduce myself again. As my assistant said, my name is Ismael, I'm a manager of my company that is 411 local. And the reason that I asked to contact me with you is because. Well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does remodeling on the area because there's a great increase on the demand of clients that are looking for this service. So what I would like to do is to see the way that we can just work together and that we can put you in front of all of this because, well, as you know, imagine if there are 1500 customers looking for this service every month between residential and commercial and you can be there for all of them. That will be as much.
Speaker B (00:58 - 00:58): Now can you please tell me on.
Speaker A (00:58 - 01:54): This way, Robert, for how long have you been running this business on your own? Yeah, four years. And then on these four years at Lenini Delay, the way that you manage to get new customers for you or the way that new prospects can be able to find you, how you do it, by the recommendations, the word of mouth. You can do business cards, suppliers, your website. Tell me how you do it. Oh, oh, sounds good. You charge it for Lee? You sell Lee or no, I didn't have it. No, not like Tupa Enghi. Nothing there. No, no, nothing like that. Don't worry, we have nothing to see with this. Yeah, also that company is qualified as one of us. But no worries, we never need to be. Nothing like that. But just me. So the way that you manage to get new customers for you are how new process will be able to find you, how useful? Or just let me ask you something, Robert, so if I can continue this in Spanish, it will be better for you or you would like to. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Robert? Hello?

Speaker B (01:35 - 01:38): I kind of live right between three big cities.
Speaker C (01:38 - 01:48): So that's a good area then, sir. You're in a good location. All right. And so at the moment, right, I mean, how's the way you guys get new customers?
Speaker B (01:49 - 02:00): I just advertise through Facebook. I got a lot of wealthy companies that I deal with. I put bids in on jobs offline, stuff like that.
Speaker C (02:00 - 02:24): Oh, wow. Okay. Server complete, man. All right. No, I don't need to spend a few times here. The reason I was asking you this. We specialize what's in the traffic search terms and Internet and winning for people fixing up handyman services in the area right there. Pretty much what we want to do for you and offer you is told you complete online presence online so people are able to find you and call you directly. All right. Is that something you've been interested in?
Speaker B (02:24 - 02:32): I Mean, the way things are going right now, I'm just, I mean I don't pay for no advertisement now. I just turned to work.
Speaker C (02:32 - 03:47): Yeah, okay. That's because of the quality work service we provide, sir. And we're not here to change it, right? We're just here to, you know, increase your value through online presence so you can have a little more conversion rate, more productivity as something extra. I don't like the tons of phone, tons of customers either, right. It will get to something extra to the point where you say it was worth doing it. Right. But it's also going in specific directions. You can have a place where to give reviews and people see the work you do. I know you mentioned earlier, right? You have a good presence of people calling you back because you have good quality work, people recommend you a lot. So if you were to do something like Peter and ya, I'm pretty sure I will spot rock you the size of limit for you because basically you've been doing this for 10 years already and you haven't needed none of this, right? Imagine when you actually try to get customers, extra customers, it'll be something good for you, right? Think about Walmart's journey. Walmart, you know they're everywhere, right? Not just because they need it, because you know, they've been doing it for like a long time, right? The branding and everything, right? So I'm not going to say you're going to be the Walmart or handyman spot, you won't get some, right? That's our goal, man. I mean if it's not today, in the future then we'll text all of our information. That way you know, you can look us up and you know, you, you guys are unbooked, you have a snowman.

Hello?
Hello, hi. Maybe you can help me.
You still do or offer handyman services?
Mass is on?
This is Ian Mitchell.
I'm actually with 411 Locals.
Maybe you can help me here because there are several people online who are looking for someone who offer handyman services.
And so my manager basically asked me to, well, look for someone who can still handle new client or new customer.
I would also like to ask if you can, uh, go ahead.
I'm not interested, thank you.
Well, if you could just hear us out because there are a significant number of interested people, sir, who are looking for someone to offer handyman services.
And as what I mentioned, my manager asked me to look for someone who can handle new client.
Since we are a company, sir, who specialize in watching and monitoring the online traffic search terms in every local area.
So, and we're trying to reach out to reliable business that we can work with who can provide quality work and will be able to handle new customers.
So we can connect those people to a business like yours who do offer free, um, handyman services.
So what are you, what are you trying to do?
Um, so on my end, since you do handyman services, sir, would you be able to cover residential and commercial work?
Hello?
Who are you with?
It's 411 Locals.
I'm with 411 Locals, sir.
Okay, how much does this cost?
So first of all, sir, regarding with the question, I do have a rough, um, pricing on my end, but we do have a program that is designed to pay per self by providing a certain business a full brand exposure.
We are basically a company responsible for building a complete online presence that covers any way a new customer would look for you online.
So just imagine this, if at any time a customer or a client searches in Google by typing a keyword like handyman services in Gulf Shores, we make sure that they see your business details, like your business name, your phone number, and if you already have a website, that will be included and that will be in front and center above your competition.
Well, not just being in front and center above your competition, but you'll be in the top place in first page of Google, sir.
Okay.
And again, sir, do you offer or provide free estimates regarding handyman services?
Yes.
All right, perfect.
And for me to address you properly, sir, again my name is Ian.
If you don't mind me asking your first name?
Uh, Casey.
Casey.
And you must be the owner, Casey?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Pleased to speak with you, Casey.
All right, just a second.
You can do residential and commercial work.
And as a handyman, Casey, do you have a crew that you work with or help you out or are you only doing this on your own?
You do have a crew.
I got a crew.
Okay.
And the phone number that I have here, this will be the only and best phone number you have for the business, or there's an alternative phone number, Casey, aside from this one?
That's the only phone number I have.
This is the best phone number.
Okay.
How about business hours, Casey?
Are you mainly work or typically work from Monday to Friday or weekends as well?
Uh, Monday to Friday.
So that will be Monday to Friday.

Speaker A (00:22 - 00:24): Now going on this way.
Speaker B (00:24 - 00:35): Let me introduce myself again. My name is Erno. I'm manager of my company that is 411 local. The reason that I asked my assistant something with you is because. Well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable man.
Speaker A (00:35 - 00:38): I was with 401 locals a long long time ago.
Speaker B (00:38 - 00:39): Uhhuh.
Speaker A (00:39 - 00:43): Like when I operated out of Missouri, I operated out of Mississippi. Yep.
Speaker B (00:43 - 00:47): Okay, so. But you were working with our company because for how long?
Speaker A (00:49 - 00:51): Oh hell, I was looking for a long time, but.
Speaker B (00:53 - 00:56): Because you said that you got 15 years on your business.
Speaker A (00:56 - 00:57): What?
Speaker B (00:57 - 01:00): So we have that you have been in business for 15 years, right?
Speaker A (01:00 - 01:03): Yeah, I've been in business ever since I worked with you last.
Speaker B (01:03 - 01:06): And you've been there with us like about 15 years.
Speaker A (01:07 - 01:12): Shoot, I don't know. Early 2000s, I imagine it's been that long, if not longer.
Speaker B (01:12 - 01:26): Because the thing is that if you've been doing it in the early 2000s, that was not with us because my company is 18 years. So we don't have like that. Because in the early 2000s it should be like 25 years. But my company.
Speaker A (01:28 - 01:40): I've worked with 401 local. You can pull up my phone number in your system and you'd be like, ah, I see what you're talking about. It's that easy. We don't have to. Whether it's what year discrepancy, you can pull it up and find them.
Speaker B (01:40 - 01:48): Okay. And then. But about the service. So how. How was the service for you that you've been working with us so well, every.
Speaker A (01:48 - 02:15): Every little while we got into it over why it wasn't Trump page, why it wasn't what it was supposed to be. But I mean here nor there. I mean like that's why I don't have a. That's why I don't even do none of that stuff anymore. I don't have anybody. I ran. I don't know how long I ran it with you guys. I ran it with another company too. And I just literally kind of after Covid, I just literally let it. All of the online stuff just go.
Speaker B (02:15 - 02:15): So.
Speaker A (02:15 - 02:36): Because I had, I had one of the companies was. I don't know, they were fighting over a domain that I purchased separately. And. And then eventually I was just like, ah, this is what it's all about. I was just giving away, I don't know, $300 a month. So that's why I didn't do it no more. And you can see that assistant, too.
Speaker B (02:37 - 02:40): So how long have you been working with us? As you said?
Speaker A (02:41 - 02:46): Not sure. I don't know. How long has it been since I haven't been? I don't remember. I just remember you said 401 local us are just.

How much a month? Be quite now and how much a month? Yeah. That's what I'm about to tell you. If you let me do it, of course, I will. So it will be a monthly rate that is a post paid service, that means that you will be only paying for the service rendered to you on the month before, so that you will be in pain on a month in delay. For an example, on January, you're paying for December, on February, January, on March, February, on April, March, and every month the same. And it's going to be just $202 with 99 cents a month.

That's amazing.
Congratulations for your new business venture.
Wow, looking forward to for more years to come.
Pretty much.
Thanks.
But of course, uh, for your service, uh, this is still the best phone number, right, for customers to contact you, or do you guys have a new phone line?
Correct.
Uh, no, this would be the best one to contact me.
Okay.
So you're very hands-on in your customer base, I believe so, right?
That's correct.
Yeah.
Yeah. Good, good.
Uh, by the way, Ruchi, since you do property, uh, maintenance, what other services do you guys offer?
Um, it's pretty much, um, almost any sort of renovation, um, just depending on which, which type of service the customer wants.
It might or might not be a proper fit for what I do.
In the sense of, let's say if it's just roofing, and I might not be the best thing, but if it's roofing plus other things, then definitely I can, uh, I can help.
Um, I do shower remodelings.
I do, uh, okay.
I'm sorry.
Um, of course, painting.
Anything that's needed, um, how do I say?
I found that anything that's needed for leasing or selling the property, it's also a good, a good combination, which it's, uh, multiple.
jobs, let's say in one.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Okay.
So you do flip houses as well for your service?
Correct.
I do what?
You do flip house?
Flip houses.
I do flips, yeah.
Ah, okay.
Oh, that's amazing.
So you're, so you're like a the jack of all trade for renovation, because you do mostly everything, right?
Oh, right.
But, but, but again, for example, if you're looking, if you're looking for a job that's only electrical, I cannot do, if it's only electrical or if it's only plumbing, um, but if it's electrical plus, uh, painting plus other stuff, uh, um, I don't know, if it's like four things together and one of those needs electrical, then yeah, definitely I can do that.
You can do that.
Okay.
So you should be, uh, four in one.
Uh, you're looking to work on it for a service.
Okay.
So Ruchi, uh,
Mhm.
Uh huh.
So as what I've mentioned to you earlier, sorry, it was my manager, right, who asked me to give you a call, and his name is Patrick.

We never ask you for any amount per lead, per call or per project because we want you to get as much as possible that help you, of course, to succeed and grow. The way that we work is that we only work with a mop fee.
Speaker D (01:59 - 02:02): But how we do it is that this will be as easy as possible.
Speaker B (02:03 - 02:30): That for too much less that what a single job can bring you, you will have more than covered the service with us. And that will be paying directly by itself. And of course from the first job you have directly gaming. And then all the other jobs that you've been doing on the week or on the month will be gaining 100% for you. And then on this way, this will be of course a great return for the investment on you because we want to be happening on the easiest way for you so that this will be as best possible for your business and.

Speaker D (02:37 - 02:38): And this is for postpaid service.
Speaker B (02:38 - 03:00): So you want it for free. Maybe you will need. Because you said that if I tell you that there's a fee, you're not there. But if I remove the fee, so you will be there, you want to cremate it, maybe a free service or how you want it? Tell me so how would you want this be working for you so that I can make it for you? Tell me. Tell me, please. On this way, Brandon. So that you're looking for customers, but you don't want to invest nothing, right?

Oh yeah, they do.
Anybody around the water knows me, I live on the water down here on Mobile.
Well, um, reason I'm actually calling Lamore is because my company, 411 Local, specializes in watching traffic of search terms on the internet.
And, even at this time of the year, we're actually still seeing people searching online and you know how it is, people nowadays, every time they look for something they'd like to buy, they typically just Google it, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Imagine this Lamore, somebody out there goes online, they go to Google and they type in, you know, uh, boat house builder, deck builder, um, porches install or pole barn contractor, even if they don't know you, they're going to see your business name and your phone number popping up in the first page of Google.
Uh, do you think it'd be beneficial for your business?
I'm honestly, I'm, I'm saying as busy as I'm to right now.
I mean, I've got, I'm booked up probably a year.
If I didn't take on another job right now, it would take me a year to get that.
Okay.
I've got like nine people working.
It's hard to get people to come to work these days.

Speaker B (00:22 - 00:24): Hi, how are you doing today?
Speaker A (00:24 - 00:25): Good, good.
Speaker B (00:25 - 00:51): Hello Juan, this is Cora Johnson. I did ask my assistant to call you because I'm currently looking for a reliable mobile mechanic in your area that we can actually work with. Because what we do here right now Juan, is that we specialize in monitoring the online traffic search of people looking for your services right now. And we're looking for a reputable business that we can actually work with. So I just wanted to ask a few questions. That way we could see if this might be a good fit. Does that make sense?
Speaker A (00:51 - 00:52): Uh huh.
Speaker B (00:52 - 00:57): I see. Well, by the way, Juan, you are the owner of the business, correct?
Speaker A (00:57 - 00:57): Yeah.
Speaker B (00:57 - 01:05): Can you tell me more about the business? Like how long have you been running the business now and what type of jobs do you really want more right now?
Speaker A (01:06 - 01:14): Well, like four years already. We do motor transmission work and all types of work suspensions.
Speaker B (01:15 - 01:21): I see. And how far are you willing to travel for that? Or how many more wages are we looking at?
Speaker A (01:22 - 01:24): Honestly, just anything around Stockton.
Speaker B (01:24 - 01:32): I see. Okay, perfect. And so far so good. I'm just curious to know how do you normally get your customers? Right now?
Speaker A (01:32 - 01:35): Right now I have an ad on Facebook, Marketplace.
Speaker B (01:35 - 02:46): Okay. And are you still open to take on more jobs right now or still? You know, you're fully right. Well, here's the thing sir, the reason why I asked you that question. Because what we do here is that we specialize in monitoring the online shopping search of people that currently are searching and looking for services. And in fact, in the past 30 days alone, Juan, there is already a total of 478 total monthly search online coming from these customers who are currently looking for mobile mechanic services. So if I could put your business in front of those interested people, that would be something very, very beneficial. Right? Yeah. Now one year is what we do. When people search online for mobile mechanic services in Stockton, they usually don't type in a business name. They just search for the service of what they're looking for. Right. Like motor transmission, crme or mobile mechanic services transaction. And if you're not showing up, your competitors are getting those phone calls. And that is the reason why we're here Juan, because what we do here at 411Locals is we want to make sure that your business will shop in front of those customers so the calls and the jobs come to you instead of someone else. Does that make sense?
Speaker A (02:46 - 02:46): Yeah.
Speaker B (02:46 - 03:29): Well, I don't know if you've heard of our company before, but our company is called 411 Locals. We're actually one of the fastest growing full fledged advertising companies in the country. We are also a certified Google partner. We have a four star rating on Google and we have over 70,000 business owners all across the US and these people stay with us one not because they have to but because they are getting results. So we will help you do the marketing for your business. So really all you gotta do is just to pick up the phone call and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy. Pretty sure you can do that, right? Yeah. Have you ever tried advertising your business? No. I see. Are you looking to advertise your business as well for you to get more customers?
Speaker A (03:30 - 03:31): Yeah.
Speaker B (03:31 - 03:32): Well, the first thing.

Speaker C (01:01 - 01:05): All right. So, Brian, how do you normally generate, like, new clients? How do you find new processes?
Speaker A (01:05 - 01:30): It's mostly just word of mouth or some newspaper ads, kind of how most of them. It's just with my father going in the business for so long, we've been able to get a decent reputation around town. So that's mostly how we. We operate. Mostly just from word of mouth.

Speaker A (01:40 - 02:04): We do a little bit of both. It's kind of 50. 50? Really? It's kind of just whatever comes about with, like I said, my father starting the business, he started off doing a lot of maintenance and landscaping, and then he moved into tree service once he established himself a little bit more. And that's kind of what we've always been doing. If we don't have one, one job, we have the other and kind of just keeps us busy all year round.
Speaker C (02:04 - 02:13): Okay, yeah, I totally understand, but what I mean, as far as, like, where can I put your. Your industry on? Is it landscaping or regular tree service that you generate?

Speaker A (02:38 - 02:48): Business grow is brilliant. Is this for, like, ads or something? I'm not really interested in promoting at the moment.
Speaker C (02:48 - 02:51): Okay, you're not. You don't want to. You don't want to basically grow your business then?

So, yeah, again, I don't want to waste your time, if that's kind of what you're. You're looking to get. I have no issue with it.

Speaker B (01:29 - 01:29): Correct.
Speaker C (01:29 - 01:51): Okay, the reason I'm asking, right, because I just did a search in your area for your type of landscaping business, and it tells you right here, on the monthly basis, there are at least 4,343 monthly searches. So there's a little bit of work right there. Right, right. And I don't know if you can recall these companies that I'm about to tell you. For example, you probably heard of this company called Provision Arbor Care. Have you heard of them?
Speaker B (01:51 - 01:51): I've not.
Speaker C (01:52 - 01:53): For Integrity Landscapes?

Speaker C (01:59 - 02:02): Okay, then you have another one called Victory Lawn Service.
Speaker B (02:02 - 02:03): I've heard of them.
Speaker C (02:03 - 02:16): Okay, but those companies right there, right, Riley, those are the ones that are getting like the big. Those are the ones that are getting like the big checks out of these already. Estate customs. And we don't see your company there, but if I could put you in front of those customers, looking for your type of service, would that be beneficial for your business?
Speaker B (02:17 - 02:24): Yeah, but I'm not looking to work with any ad agencies right now or website builders or anything like that.
Speaker B (02:27 - 02:30): I've dealt with multiple companies like this. It's not for me.
Speaker C (02:30 - 02:34): Okay. Okay. So you had bad experience or what's something you.
Speaker B (02:34 - 02:38): Yeah, I was about to say I can do all the advertising myself.
Speaker C (02:38 - 02:47): I mean, yeah, right. Anybody can do it. But I mean, like I said, you got people that professional doing this for years, right? I worked with for a media company.

So Ms. Julie, I have here my manager, Ms. Ice. Ms. Ice. Julie can handle more customers for the business. He is. She is doing H Vac contracting in North Carolina. Ms. Julie, my manager, Ms. Ice will be taking the call if you don't. Okay, thank you.
Speaker B (00:35 - 00:38): Hi Julie, how you doing today? Hi, how are you?
Speaker C (00:38 - 00:40): I'm great. Nothing to complain about.
Speaker B (00:40 - 00:40): Yourself?
Speaker C (00:40 - 00:41): Well, that's great.
Speaker B (00:41 - 00:42): Here.
Speaker C (00:43 - 01:00): So this is Aris Bello, Julie, area manager for women local. And I asked my assistant to call you because we're looking for a reliable business in the area we can work with. So I'm going to ask a few quick questions to see if it's going to be a good fit. So what kind of H Vac jobs do you usually take on June?
Speaker B (01:00 - 01:02): We do mostly residency.
Speaker C (01:02 - 01:06): And do you have a minimum charge for each job or just really depends?
Speaker B (01:06 - 01:07): It just depends.
Speaker C (01:07 - 01:27): But one thing is for sure, you accept multi big jobs, right? Awesome. And which areas are the most profitable events for your jobs? If you don't mind me asking. Let's now wait just how 14 year old, How much is. How far can you go?
Speaker B (01:27 - 01:39): We're not looking to go with a company that can send us referrals like that. We're a small company, mostly do word of mouth referrals with our. So we're not sourced. Is that what you're trying?
Speaker C (01:39 - 02:27): Well, what we provide here usually is a maximum online exposure and a complete online presence. So the main goal of our program is to make sure that customers cannot be expensive and everything. We deserve it. That way they can reach directly and they can pay directly. Because right now we've been seeing an increase in demand. And the number of people that are looking and are searching for your type of service, they just can't find you yet. That's why they cannot reach you. Imagine, Julie, just for. Just for the past 50 days in the area for H Vac there's about 833 number of searches from people who need and are looking for the service. So if I could put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested, that are already looking for the service, for sure that will be very beneficial for the company.
Speaker B (02:27 - 02:35): Right, I see. That. But we're not doing any advertising third party. Y' all reaching out to us that you find some people that you're.
Speaker C (02:35 - 02:54): Well, if you could just share them out. I understand you're not interested. This may not be something that you're looking for, but just hear me out at least, Julie. So at least you know what we can offer here. And anyway, if you don't like what you hear from me, then we can forgave this fan. So how do you generate customers now, Julie, I want to ask. Or how do you get more customers?
Speaker B (02:54 - 02:56): Well, we're most girl based.
Speaker C (02:56 - 02:59): So you haven't tried advertising at all even putting your business up?

Speaker A (00:52 - 00:54): Well, good, thank God, all is well.
Speaker C (00:55 - 02:33): Great. Look, now I'll introduce myself again. As my assistant said, my name is Ismael, I am the manager of my company called 411 local. The reason I asked to contact you is because I see that you have a pretty reliable business, Frank, and I'm looking for a person with a reliable business who can get more work because there is a great demand for customers. They are looking for this service that you perform in the dragon area and remodeling. So what I want is to be able to put you in front of all those people so that this is clear, right? So that it is of the greatest possible benefit. Well, imagine, you know that we are in an excellent area, right, Frank? And if we have more than 1,500 people, both residential and commercial, looking for this service like the one you do and you are there for them, it would be of the greatest benefit going this way. So what I want is that we can work together, Frank, so that we can put you in front of all these people and that in this way this happens. Also, Frank, without you having to make any additional effort, that is, you as such, you are only taking care of the part that has to do with answering your phone when they seek you, making the payments that are directly requested from you for the service, and of course, for each job you do, receiving that payment for the service that has been given. But more than anything, do what you do best, right? Which is to provide a quality service and keep your customers, which I feel is something you can easily do, right?
Speaker A (02:34 - 02:41): Yes, yes, but we are very behind right now and we are not interested right now.
Speaker C (02:41 - 02:44): But tell me what you wouldn't be interested in from what I told you.
Speaker A (02:44 - 02:53): No, well, we already have enough work and we don't need more customers, the ones we have are enough.
Speaker C (02:53 - 02:58): But for example, when my assistant asked you if you could have more clients and you said yes, then it wasn't true.
Speaker A (02:58 - 03:03): Yes, it's true, but we are not interested.
Speaker C (03:04 - 03:05): In, so you can have more.
Speaker A (03:05 - 03:11): Clients but it is not interesting to communicate today, no, I don't want to have more people.
Speaker C (03:11 - 03:13): But not with me, in another way or.
Speaker A (03:13 - 03:39): With someone more trustworthy. Well, right now we don't have any confidence in you, we don't know you and I don't know anything about that, I have to do research and see what your work is about.

Speaker C (02:06 - 02:09): Yes, yes. So in total, it's four of us.
Speaker B (02:09 - 02:09): Great.
Speaker C (02:09 - 02:11): We kind of work together. Yeah.
Speaker B (02:12 - 02:17): So if I were to send you 20 leads in a month, how many would you be able to grow or to accommodate?
Speaker C (02:17 - 02:19): 20 leads in a month. I'd be able to do all of them.
Speaker B (02:19 - 02:31): I love that. Well, that's the spirit and the mindset of a business owner we're looking for. Now, speaking of leads, so how do you generate customers now or how do you get more customers? Speaking about business cards, it's about flyers. Do you host online?
Speaker C (02:33 - 02:39): Well, we have a lot of it. Word of mouth. We have. We have a Yelp account.
Speaker C (02:41 - 02:42): We have.
Speaker C (02:44 - 02:47): Angie's List. So I'm assuming.
Speaker B (02:47 - 02:52): I'm assuming you're. I'm assuming you're paying Angie and Yelp. Right, because they know them so well.
Speaker C (02:52 - 02:53): You're paying them.
Speaker B (02:53 - 02:56): Right. And how is it so far? Is it worth it, though?
Speaker C (02:57 - 02:59): It's going good. I mean, I can't complain.
Speaker B (02:59 - 03:25): Right? Right. Well, I was just surprised because I know them so well. I mean, I don't want to brag or I don't even want to badmouth them, but 60% of our customers are actually coming from them because normally what they do. I'm not sure if this is the type of service you've got from them, but normally what Angie or Yelp does, they send you leads at the same time they send it to other contractors. So you're the one calling customers. And even if you don't get the job, you still have to pay for. You have been kicked from this conference.

Speaker B (00:04 - 00:20): Christian, maybe you can help me. Are you still doing garage and your cleanout services? Yes, in Lansdale. Okay, perfect. Yeah. By the way, this is Adele. Am I speaking with the owner of the business? Right. For garage cannot service.
Speaker C (00:21 - 00:23): Are you the actual homeowner?
Speaker B (00:23 - 00:23): I'm sorry?
Speaker C (00:24 - 00:25): You're the homeowner?
Speaker B (00:25 - 00:47): Oh no. I'm calling you from 411 locals and my name is Adele. And I'm calling you because we're seeing a search people in your area who's searching online for garage layout services. So my manager asked me to reach out to a few local business that can actually take on my customer. Do you still accept residential or you do commercial service?
Speaker C (00:47 - 00:48): I'm residential, Raymond.
Speaker B (00:48 - 00:52): Me Residential. And what is your name for me to address you properly?
Speaker A (00:52 - 00:55): I'm the owner and CEO of the company, Christian.
Speaker B (00:55 - 01:19): Hi Christian, by the way. Christian, just to be clear, we're not looking for work, but we help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service. It's about reviewing a few local businesses for potential placements in front of a real customer searches. And my manager just confirmed which one fits the criteria. Are you able to handle new customer Landsville for garage cleanout service?
Speaker C (01:20 - 01:24): Are you guys giving them the rate or how does it work? Like am I paying you?
Speaker B (01:24 - 01:53): Oh no, Christian, the great thing with 411Locals is we are not selling leads and customer for you to pay or for you to handle. Because what we usually do is we are looking for a reliable business partner that we can work with because we do study the number of people going online who's searching for your kind of service and we connect them directly to yours. So how long have you been doing the garage clean out services in Lansdale?
Speaker C (01:54 - 01:56): Well, I just started my business up.
Speaker A (01:56 - 02:07): In like January, February time, so I haven't been doing it too long. But I just helped a client moving out of her house and it was rented my truck and move stuff over.
Speaker B (02:07 - 02:16): Sounds perfect. By the way, do you have some workers that would help you present for commercial service or do you work alone for the service?
Speaker A (02:17 - 02:22): But it would depend on the size of the job.
Speaker B (02:22 - 02:25): But you're open to do the free estimate, right?
Speaker A (02:25 - 02:26): Correct.
Speaker B (02:26 - 02:32): Okay. And are you available to work on weekends, Christian, or is it only Mondays through Saturday that you do?
Speaker C (02:34 - 02:38): Sometimes I'm available. Depends on the size of the job though.
Speaker A (02:38 - 02:40): Like if it's a large job, I would probably have to.
Speaker A (02:42 - 02:43): For like a weekend time.
Speaker B (02:43 - 02:47): Okay, so that includes Saturdays and Sundays, right?
Speaker A (02:47 - 02:47): Correct.
Speaker B (02:47 - 02:54): Wonderful. Do you also do the travel, Christian, or is it Only locally in Lunchdale that you're providing your services.
Speaker C (02:55 - 02:59): I mean, I've just serviced a client. I just stepped on a client in.
Speaker A (02:59 - 03:05): Jersey, but I'm trying not to have to drive that far because it was like two hours each way. It was kind of more of like a family.
Speaker A (03:07 - 03:09): Long family member.
Speaker C (03:09 - 03:11): I mean, I think I have a.
Speaker A (03:11 - 03:17): Client this week coming up in Phoenixville. Most of my clients right now are in Lansdale though.
Speaker B (03:17 - 03:24): Oh, okay, I see then. But do you charge extra if you're going to get to travel like 20 to 30 miles from your location?
Speaker A (03:24 - 03:30): More than likely, yeah. It would be a set rate depending on the mileage.
Speaker B (03:30 - 03:34): Oh, okay. But it will still depends on the project. Right. That you're gonna do.
Speaker A (03:35 - 03:45): Right. Because if they're in landfill, then it's not really. I'm not going to rate them for a travel fee because I think most of my jobs right now for landfill are like less than two miles.
Speaker B (03:45 - 03:45): Oh, okay.
Speaker A (03:45 - 03:51): There's a job that I have that's like 36 miles both ways. And I had charged for that one.
Speaker B (03:51 - 04:04): I do, and I totally understand that that if you're going to do a service, charge for the transportation on the top of the service. But anyway, Christian, like you have mentioned, you can also do commercial service, right?
Speaker C (04:05 - 04:05): I haven't.
Speaker A (04:05 - 04:18): None of my rates are set for commercial service. I would really have to see the vastness of the jobs because then at that point I would have to probably hire somebody that would be able to assist me to move stuff.
Speaker B (04:18 - 04:22): Oh, okay. So you're focusing mainly residential at this time. Correct.
Speaker A (04:22 - 04:22): Right.
Speaker C (04:22 - 04:24): But what kind of commercial jobs were.

Speaker B (01:57 - 01:57): Yeah.

Speaker B (02:13 - 02:13): Yep.
Speaker C (02:13 - 02:19): And I don't know if you can recall these companies that I'm about to tell you for example, have you heard of something called loaded up junk removal?

Speaker C (02:21 - 02:23): Or Junk Kings, Massachusetts South?

Speaker C (02:57 - 03:02): Like by doing your Google listing, your website. Then we put you on directories and.
Speaker B (03:02 - 03:08): In front of Google, we already pay someone that does a really good job, so it wouldn't be worth doing it for someone else.

Speaker C (00:22 - 00:57): Okay, perfect. Glad to hear that. Look, so we don't take too much of your time or mind. Let me go ahead and introduce myself very quickly. My name is Art, and I'm the area manager for four hundred and eleven locals. And the reason why we're calling you today, Carlos, is because we're looking for reliable business around your area to work with. Just want to ask you a few questions here that way we can find out to see if this would be a good fit for both our companies. Right now we can just go ahead and part where scratch and nothing happened here. So according to my assistant, you're in the industry here for car detailing for about three years already. Is that correct? On your own Sorry.
Speaker A (00:59 - 01:06): Do you have somebody who speak Spanish? I learned English, but I don't spell much English now.
Speaker C (01:06 - 01:09): OK, OK. Oh, you only speak Spanish, is that correct?
Speaker A (01:10 - 01:13): Yes, but I also speak a little English. Excuse me?

Speaker B (01:21 - 01:22): Sure, sure.
Speaker C (01:22 - 01:30): Now, regarding car detailing, if someone were to call you, right, if a client contacted you, could you assist them in English?
Speaker B (01:30 - 01:31): Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker A (01:31 - 01:33): The majority of the students speak.
Speaker A (01:36 - 01:36): English.
Speaker C (01:37 - 01:42): They speak English. OK, perfect. Very good. So, you could, just that you prefer Spanish.
Speaker A (01:42 - 01:59): Speaking Spanish or not, it doesn't matter the language they speak, we still know how to express what the client needs, I mean, like if a client comes and speaks to me in English, well, I already know what I have to tell them. I know those kinds of comments when speaking.
Speaker C (02:01 - 02:37): I understand, I understand. Yes. Look, we're calling you to offer you services and you only work, well, correctly work, if, for example, you can hold a conversation correctly with a client, right? That's why I was asking you that. But you're telling me that there's no problem with that. OK, OK, perfect. Very good. I'm going to have my assistant call you back then so we can schedule a call with you and we can explain everything that we can do here for you. Would you be interested in these types of services, Carlos, to get better clients?
Speaker A (02:37 - 02:46): OK, but my question is, why the call? What is the purpose of what you want to propose to have?
Speaker C (02:46 - 03:05): Exactly, we do or help clients like you through online marketing services. That's what we do so that you can obviously have better, let's say, better online presence and obviously better traffic of new clients. Would that be of interest for your business?
Speaker A (03:06 - 03:12): Yes, but I would have to discuss it with my other calls, which then maybe.
Speaker A (03:14 - 03:15): How would you say it.
Speaker A (03:16 - 03:20): After having talked about it with my partner, then give you an answer.
Speaker C (03:20 - 03:25): OK, perfect, very good, thank you very much. Have an excellent day, Carlos. Bye bye.

Not really looking for anything more than I have now unless it's a little side work, you know, if you guys get busy. But other than that, man.

Uh, what I'm trying to ask, Jeremiah, did you stay in Dallas only with your service or you travel around the state of Texas? And what cities are you covered? We travel, we travel where the work is at. Okay. It doesn't really matter, depending on the price. We traveled to Louisiana, we traveled to Missouri. I see. I will take note that. So, yeah, and also, um, I mean, uh, how long have you running this business, Jeremiah? For how many years? Uh, it's been active for about 15 years actually. 15 15 years for the business. Wow, that's great. I will take note that, Jeremiah. So, Jeremiah, actually have here my manager Gabriel Hismayel. This is Jeremiah, one of the owner.

15 years for the business.
Well, sounds great.
I will think I'm that you're in my ass.
So, Jeremiah actually I'm here, my manager give a call, hey smile.
This is Jeremiah one of the owner.
He can handle Marc also as well.
He can decide for marketing and financial decisions.
Okay, that's great.
Thank you.
Hi Jeremiah, how are you today?
Fine, how are you doing?
Oh, that's great to hear Jeremiah.
I'm glad to know that you are doing good.
And also, well, thank you for asking.
I'm doing great.
Thanks to God.
Now, Jeremiah, let me introduce myself again.
As my assistant said, my name is Esmael.
I'm a manager of my company that is 411 locals.
So, the reason that I ask him to contact me with you, Jeremiah, is because well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does remodeling service on the area because there's a great increase on the demand of customers looking for this.
And what I would like to do is to see the way that we can just work together and that we can put you in front of all of these people so that this will be as much beneficial.
Now, on this way, Jeremiah, so imagine, if we are in a great city, right?
You know that it's a great, great city.
And imagine if there are more than 2500 customers between residential and commercial and you can be there for all of them, that will be as much as beneficial, right?
Now, can you please tell me, Jeremiah, on these 15 years that you've been on business, the way that you manage to get new customers for you or the way that new prospects can be able to find you?
How do you do it on that way?
Tell me, please.
So the way that you are trying to keep your business close.
How do we get our work?
Yeah, how do you make customers come to you or how do you manage it for an example, I don't know, recommendation.
Oh, it's mainly by word of mouth.
Uh-huh.
It's word of mouth and then we have lots of, we have lots of connections with multiple different companies that know our work and that we do high end work.
We do it fair price.
And I mean that's how we don't promote any kind of we don't do any kind of publicity.
We just do word of mouth because that keeps us busy.
We don't need to do any kind of commercial, Facebook ads or any of that because that's just over, that's too much overhead, you don't need to do it.
So but that's something that you are not looking or that you don't like to make for your business and that's what I hear.
I mean it's it's there's there's no reason for it.
So I mean, to be honest, we stay very busy uh without that.
So if we had that, it would be an it would be an extra cost that we wouldn't want for one.
And then two, we probably wouldn't be able to you know, handle the overload of work that we would probably get.
So in that way you are not able to get like more customers for you?
Oh no, we have plenty of work.
So you are not open for the get more customers, right?
Oh, I mean I'm I'm I'm willing to do work.
I'm willing to do work.
Depending on what the work is and we always want more work, it's just when you talk about ads, you know, a lot of people like to do like billboards or commercials or make signs up.
I think that's a lot of wasted space.
Right, right.
So but you are you you can be able to get more customers or not?
Yeah, I mean we we we we're always wanting more work, it's just that because we're not to we don't we don't is that we can just give you the presence, the optimization and the maximum exposure when all of the customers that are looking for the service that you do, the option that they always find and get it will be you and your business, but also that this will happens without you doing any additional effort so that it will be as easy as possible and that you can be only in charge of picking up the phone for the customers that are looking for you, making the jobs that they are asking, receiving the payment from the service that you provide and making the things that I know that you can do the best.",,,ISMAELMALENCOCORDOVA,jerimiah ,,"dallas, tx, ",remodeler,1,1,0,jerimiah ,remodeler,"dallas, tx, ",Central,Low season,December,Consultative & Validating,Male,Yes,,No,Yes,No,Happy/Optimistic,English,Yes,available,Agent,Transactional (Buyer),2.8,"Audio Stability, Intelligibility, Environmental Distractions",TRUE,,36.84,63.16,Agent-Heavy,1,0,1,0,Surface-Level,No,1,4,1:04,Resistant,Confident & Assumptive,Agent,15,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Not Found in Transcript,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,No,3.75,80,2,9,1,0,2,2,0.5,Occasional,Agent-Heavy,Unstructured,FOMO; ROI Calculation; Assume Sale,Value Proposition,No,Yes,5,3,Professional,Yes,No,Stable,Skeptical,Resistant,,Resistant,,4 frustrations,0,0,242,Value Proposition,Agent,80,No Commitment Secured,,No,No,No,No,Disconnect - During Pitch/Value Prop,Not qualified/not interested

Toledo, Ohio.

Uh, honestly, it really depends. It's all uh, the time based thing for me at the moment. I got a lot of things going on and a lot of bigger jobs going. So, uh, pretty much any repair work.
Mhm. Okay. So, repair work definitely depends on, you know, the size of the repair. What exactly they want it repaired to. A lot of times they don't just want to repair, they want to change, so things like that.
Okay. I want to give you um, a timeline and don't have, you can honestly can't, can't do it. So, I'm just being honest up with you.
Okay. Appreciate that. Well, see, the reason I'm calling, J, is because my company, we have actually monitored a significant amount of uh, traffic going on from uh, people searching and looking for your service. And uh, you know how it is. People typically nowadays, when they search for something they like to buy, they Google it, right?
Mhm.
Now, if we talk about Toledo and and the surrounding areas, 30 mile radius for the past 30 days, I'm actually seeing here a total of over 15,708 searches from people looking for somebody who does handyman repair works. Now, if at anytime uh, J, somebody goes online, they go to Google and they would type in, you know, uh, handyman repair work or, you know, plumbing repair, um, electrical repair. Even if they don't know you, they're going to see your business name, phone number popping up first page Google in front of them. Do you think that'd be beneficial for your business?
No. Not at this current moment.

So, I'm just going to ask a few quick questions to see if it's going to be a good fit. So, Derrick, what kind of moving jobs do you usually take on?
Commercial and residential.
Great. You do long distance moving, right?
Uh, just pretty much how far. That's fine. Speaking of, so how, I mean which areas are the most profitable or best for your jobs?
Dallas-Fort Worth.
East Texas.
Oh. Can I confirm your zip code, please?

Thank you so much. And do you have people helping you out or you're just doing it alone?
No, I have a couple workers.
Oh, that's great. How many people do you have if you don't mind me asking?
Six.
Six. That's great. So, if I were to send you 30 leads in a month, how many would you be able to accept or accommodate?
You say how many, excuse me?
If I were to send you 30 leads in a month, how many would you be able to accommodate or accept?
13 in a month?
30, 3-0.
Um, I can cover at least 20.
Oh, that's great. Not bad. Now, speaking of leads, how do you generate customers now or how do you get more customers now? Do you give out business cards? Do you give out flyers?
Business card, uh word of mouth. Um, just any way I can. Social media, any way.
Right, right. And someone's helping you with that one or just managing everything yourself?
Uh, I have my wife, she helps me.
Oh, wow. At least you have your wife that is always there. Now, the reason I ask, so our company, Derrick, specializes in monitoring the traffic of search terms online.
Okay. We called you because we're seeing increase in demands and the number of people that are searching for your type of service.
Okay. In fact, for the past 30 days in the area for moving, we're seeing about 836 number of searches from people that are looking for your type of service. They just can't find you yet. That's why they cannot reach you.
Okay. So, if I could put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested and are already looking for the service.
For sure that will be very beneficial for the company, right?
Absolutely. Now, Derrick, do you know the company Carlos Movers?
No.
How about Luke's or Beto's moving number two? Does it ring a bell?
No.
Well, to be honest, I don't know them. I'm just asking because these are the companies right now in the area that I'm seeing on the first page getting the phone calls. And I don't see your company name here yet. That's why we call you because we want to put your name front and center above them.

Speaker A (00:30 - 00:59): The reason that I asked my assistant to contact me with you is because, well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does on this service. Right. Because, well, there's a great increase in the demand of customers that are looking for the service that we provide as a handyman. And what we would like to do is see the way that we can put you in front of all of these customers so that this will be as much because, well, as you know, we are in a great city and there are more than 1500 customers looking for this service. And imagine if you can be there for all of that customers that will be as much beneficial. Right?

Speaker A (01:00 - 01:05): Now going on this week, Brennan, can you please tell me for how long have you been joining them this business on your own?
Speaker B (01:06 - 01:08): I've been doing it for a while. I just had a quick question.
Speaker B (01:10 - 01:18): I've gotten a call like this before when I've done stuff like this before. I'm guessing you guys are just gonna try to connect me to people and you guys are gonna charge me a monetary to do that.
Speaker A (01:18 - 02:00): Yep. But not to connect you with people. We work with the monthly fee. But it's a different way that we do things because the way that we work is working together as a team. And then on this way, the service that you will be seeing, that the constant flow of work and the jobs that you're getting and the income that you're receiving, this will be paid directly by itself, but it works with a monthly payment. And we are not going to ask you for the monthly payment in advance. It's a post page service that means that we will show you first everything that we are creating, the things that we are getting and the benefits that this is giving you so that you can be happy with the service. And, and then when it comes the time for your payment, it's because you are paying for the service rendered to you on the month before and then for sure happy with this we can continue working as much time as possible. Brendan.
Speaker B (02:00 - 02:10): Awesome. Well, I'm okay without the service. I'm doing pretty good by myself. But thank you guys for reaching out. I'm all right without the service. You guys have a good rest of your day.
Speaker A (02:10 - 02:26): No, no thanks to you, Brennan. And also, if you can show me just that I can documentate that what's the reason that you are not able to make this. So I understand that you're okay, but you. How you are, that's the only consideration, that you cannot be able to make it that I can documentate that information if you can help. Well, I just. I just.

Speaker B (01:31 - 01:37): Can you tell me though, Amber, how much you guys usually charge off an average job? If we can give you a ballpark, it depends.
Speaker A (01:38 - 02:02): It depends. Normally if it's just one trailer full, it'd be roughly $20 to take it. If we have to take it to the dump, if it's that we are removing all the stuff with no help from the person that we're doing it with, you're looking at like anywhere from 75 to $100.
Speaker B (02:02 - 02:33): Okay. Now here's actually a reason I called amber. My company, Man 4 one of the locals specialize in watching traffic of search terms and Internet. And we're seeing a significant amount of traffic going on even at this time of the year from people searching. And if we talk about Rock county and the surrounding areas, about 50 mile radius for the past 30 days, I'm actually seeing here a total of over 4882 searches. From people looking for junk removal. That's a lot of searches, right?
Speaker A (02:33 - 02:33): Yeah.
Speaker B (02:34 - 02:49): Imagine this, Amber. Somebody out there goes online, they go to Google, and they would type in junk removal search. Even if they don't know you guys, they're going to see your business name, your phone number popping up in first page Google in front of them. Do you think it'd be beneficial for your businessman?
Speaker A (02:50 - 02:57): No, Honestly, I'm not looking to take on a whole bunch of clients. We're looking to take on enough that we can handle.

So, uh, according to my assistant, you're in the industry here for cell phone and computer repair services. Is that correct?
Yes.
Okay, okay. And for how long have you been running your own company, uh, Jesus?
Almost like uh 15 years.
Oh, wow. Okay, okay. So you got plenty of experience already. Congratulations on that, my man. And uh, throughout those uh, 15 years that you have almost 15 years, like you said, uh, how do you been getting new clients for your company? How do you get new clients?
The way like uh, everybody they doing, you know, like a TikTok, TikTok, basically, Snapchat, Facebook.
Okay, so social media?
Yeah.
Okay, okay, perfect. And how's that working out? Social media?
Honestly? Uh-huh. Honestly, very good, you know, whatever customer I get from the physical store, because so I getting most of the, yeah, I getting most of the customer by the TikTok or I getting
Yeah. Facebook.
Okay, okay. And yeah, which is is strange, right? Because people don't really go there to shop. They usually go there, uh, you know, to see uh, what's the trend or anything like that. But you're getting uh, pretty good uh, feedback from that. That's really, really good. So now, uh, here Jesus, do you have any challenges as far as getting new clients? Or is that your main source?
That one is my main source, you know. So I use like a different thing. So I have one, you know, I like like a flyers on the small permanents, or parking lots, close to the store.
Flyers, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure. Okay, okay.
And uh, so right now here, Jesus, uh, if we were to refer you with clients that are already looking for this type of services, uh, is that something that you might be interested in, getting more traffic, getting uh, more more clients?
Look, right now, the way I'm telling you, so it's kind of unusual, okay? So right now, I invest with the Google Ads.
So, whatever Google Ads. Whatever they have, I do them like a social media and Google Ads. And it's working.
Uh-huh. Right now, I cannot right now, I cannot permit myself to pay like uh, something extra, you know, when you start like a new business.
Sure, sure, sure. So right now you don't you don't have any, yeah, any budget for marketing. That's what you're saying, right?
Yes. Yes. Right now at the moment maybe in a couple months, two, three months more, yes, maybe I can invest with you guys. But now I think right now at the moment is not possible to me.
Okay, okay. Definitely understand that. No worries. Uh, sometimes that's what happens Jesus. But let me go ahead and send you some information here about our company. If at some point, right? Uh, you think this could be a uh, a good fit here for your company, please uh, give us a call and we can definitely go ahead and do that. Now, uh, another fact that I'm going to give you so you see you know, right? Uh, social media, like I said, obviously people don't really go there to shop. Obviously you have had a uh, a different response. But uh, also there's like thousands and thousands of uh, you know what I mean, people or uh, competitors that are going to be there for you. So, we can definitely go ahead and make that happen better with better clients and and you know, better income here for your company. But once you're ready to do that to take that uh, step here for your company, please give us a call Jesus and uh, we'll go ahead and help you out, okay?

And that is the reason why we didn't call you is because right at this moment, we have seen that out of those 802,000 population in the city, there is already A total of 42,605 total monthly coming from these people who need different kinds of services for cleaning. So if I could put your business in front of those interested people. Would that be beneficial?
Speaker C (02:26 - 02:27): How would that work?
Speaker B (02:28 - 02:51): Well, here's what we do. When people search online for cleaning services, or most definitely for professional cleaning, they usually don't type in a business name. Right? They just search for the service of what they're looking for. Either it's crime, skin cleaning specialist, professional cleaning, industrial cleaning, mobile, mobile cleaning, react cleaning. Near me. Your competitors are getting those phone calls, right?
Speaker C (02:52 - 02:56): Thank you so much for your call, but I'm not interested at the moment for that.
Speaker B (02:56 - 02:58): Okay, Danny. All right.
Speaker C (02:58 - 02:59): Have a good day. Bye.

Just I want to ask you a few questions to see if this will be a good fit.

Speaker C (01:37 - 02:03): I see, I see. Okay, so basically the reason why we reaching out because within the last 30 days, I mean, we have a lot of searches for like mechanical services, like auto mechanic. The services we want you to do, Mike, are not for us. That's for the people that search online locally when they need them. So if we can, let's say we have like over 3,000 searches within the last 30 days. If I can put you in front of those people that are already looking for your services, Mike, like you say they need you, right?
Speaker A (02:03 - 02:04): You don't need them.
Speaker C (02:04 - 02:07): Do you think that will be beneficial for your business?
Speaker B (02:08 - 02:12): It will for sure. But you don't have to pay a fee to use your service, correct?
Speaker C (02:12 - 02:38): I mean, it's like a monthly thing, right? You don't pay it like at the beginning, you pay after we did the service for you, right? Yeah. And that's all. But we, I mean, the return of investment will be huge for you. You know, like, we are very flexible. I'll go ahead and explain the project. If you like what you hear, Mike, we can move forward, right? If not, we can part ways. Friends, Mike, if you have the time, nothing to compromise.
Speaker B (02:38 - 02:44): I mean, right now I'm pretty actually busy. I'm under a car right now. You'll be busy all the time.
Speaker C (02:45 - 02:53): Okay, so if you're busy, you tell me when would be the best time if you really might want me to call you back, right? And what we do, right?
Speaker B (02:54 - 02:55): How much is your service?
Speaker C (02:55 - 03:01): Okay, it goes by zip code. What is your zip code? I have 44105 right here. Mike, steal that one.
Speaker B (03:01 - 03:05): 441-224-4122.

Hi. Good. Good afternoon, sir. What's up? Yeah, I. I'm calling to see if you still do roadside assistance services in Santa Cruz. What do you need? What do you need? Yeah, by the way, sir, I'm calling because we're seeing several people there in Santa Cruz area. Those who are looking for the roadside and sewing services online. So my manager asked me to look for someone who can accommodate new customers and that. You are the owner, sir, for roadside service tax. Yeah. I'm not understanding what you're looking for though. What do you exactly need? Or you have a business? Oh, by the way, sir, I am calling because we are seeing a search of people there in Santa Cruz area. Those who are searching online, free type of service. So my manager asked me to reach out to a few local businesses that can actually take on more customers. So my name is Chris, by the way, sir. Yeah. Okay, so you guys have customers or what is this? Yes, sir, we are looking for a. So just to be curious right now we're not looking for work. So we help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service. Their incentive. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. Okay. Yes, sir. Okay. And who do you, who do you work for? Yeah, I'm with 411 locals, by the way. So aside from roadside assistance, sir, what other services do you provide? Like, you know, like mechanic services? No, no, nothing like that. It's literally just what's on the app. So it would just roadside, it would be just gas, the battery, substart and then lockdown. Okay, that's it. Yes. Battery and the lockout in whole Santa Cruz. Or do you also travel just around the area, sir? Yeah, I do. The surrounding area. It's pretty much like Santa Cruz County. Okay, that's even wonderful. And who am I speaking with, by the way? This is David, David for the owner. David. I'm actually sure my manager is on the other line and we'll take the call if you don't mind. Would that be okay? You want me to talk to your manager? Yes, actually my manager is on the other line and we'll take the call if that's okay. I'll go ahead and introduce you. Okay, perfect. Okay, so that is Santa Cruz and surrounding areas. So one quick question. How far do you travel? Not, I mean, just in the Santa Cruz area, basically like county. Talking about like Belton County. Yeah, Belton, Watsonville, you know, Scott Valley. So yeah, so I guess I'm still trying to figure out what you guys are trying to accomplish here. Okay, sure. Before I introduce you to my manager, David. So we are looking for a reliable business to work with who mainly does roadside assistance services there in the area. Yeah. The reason why is because we are seeing an increase of demand of those potential customers who are searching for it online right now. So my, so my manager asked me to look for a business that can still accommodate new customers or still open for new clients. You know, like for same day for appointment. Yeah, yeah. Well, usually what this would be the same day because when you need roadside service, it's something that needs to get done right away. Yes, of course, same day. So that's the reason why I'm asking earlier if aside from, you know, roadside assistance, if you also do mobile mechanic services, because some mobile mechanics. Okay, roadside. So that's for gas, blackout and battery. Okay. Like a Jamstar. Oh, I'm just taking out all of these information, David, you know, so my, my manager would know more about your roadside assistance services and the other services that you provide there in Santa Cruz County. Okay, I'm doubting now on my measure here. Let me just. You're not busy right now? You're not doing any, you're not, you're not busy right now? No, yeah, no, I mean, I'm just trying to figure out what, what you guys need. Yeah, no, no worries, David, because my, my manager will be the one to further discuss it with you real quick. Okay. The reason why we are looking for someone who. Yeah, I was, I'm dialing on the manager on the other line, David, and I'm waiting for my manager to pick up and then I'll go ahead and introduce you. Okay, let me. Okay, so this is for like 24 7, no. Yeah, it's just mainly like during the day. Okay. It's not a full like toll service company, all of that. This is just live services, but not for side jobs. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's it, you know, so that's why I'm wondering what, what's all the questions for? I mean, obviously if you need service. I, I, I don't know what else to answer. Do you know anybody that needs a service? Yeah, no worries, David, because my manager car will be the one to first discuss. Discuss it with you? Yeah. You haven't talked to. I haven't. You still keep asking what's going on. I already have her. My manager. I have her car. I have her, David, the owner who does roadside assistance services for gas, blackout and battery in Santa Cruz county. And he's still taking his offer.

Speaker B (00:50 - 01:13): Sounds good. And by the way, Brian, just to be clear, we're not looking for work, but we help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service. It's about reviewing a few local businesses for potential placements in front of a real customer searcher. And my manager just confirmed which one fits the criteria. And you're able to handle new customer, right? For auto repair services?
Speaker A (01:13 - 01:14): Yes, ma'. Am.

Speaker B (01:20 - 01:25): Five years. And you have some workers, right? Or do you work alone for the service?
Speaker A (01:26 - 01:29): I have some workers. The majority I work by myself.
Speaker B (01:29 - 01:37): Oh, okay. So majority you're working by your own, but if you have some. If you need some help with, you have, right?

Speaker A (01:53 - 01:53): Yes.
Speaker B (01:53 - 01:58): But you don't do mobile service. It only needs to be done on your physical shop, right?
Speaker A (01:59 - 02:01): I do mobile if I need to.

Speaker B (02:17 - 02:21): How much is your charge for 20 to 30 miles from your location, Brian?
Speaker A (02:21 - 02:24): It all depends on which area I'm going to.
Speaker B (02:24 - 02:24): Okay.
Speaker A (02:26 - 02:32): It'll be about an hour. It all depends on the job. And it depends on which side time I'm going to.
Speaker B (02:32 - 02:46): Oh, okay, sounds perfect. I'll do it. And by the way, Brian. Yeah? Since you are available to do the service, mobile service and you charge it will still depends on the project, right? I believe.

That's why I called you.
Speaker B (00:04 - 00:06): And by the way, in Jagros, I.
Speaker A (00:06 - 00:14): Have my manager here who asked me to call you. Benjamin. We have Jagros under handyman and Saco services. They are doing residential service.
Speaker C (00:14 - 00:15): Hi.
Speaker B (00:15 - 00:22): Thank you. Hello. Hi. Thank you. My comments. This is Benjamin Agri, manager with former locals. How you doing today?
Speaker D (00:22 - 00:23): Good, thank you. And you?
Speaker B (00:24 - 00:42): I've been doing good, thanks for asking me. I appreciate you. I was going to ask clients to call you. Reaching out. We're looking for a real business just like you that would like to take normal work and that's because we've seen a search of people online searching up handyman services in your area. So we just want to ask a few questions, Jagros, to see if you can be a good match for this.
Speaker D (00:42 - 00:43): No, thank you.
Speaker B (00:44 - 01:00): First time we're calling you, right? Wouldn't be either. That's why I sent you a text a minute ago, so you can see how we can generate more leads, more business for your company. And I wanted just one minute from your time straight. I think you like it. I'll hang up on myself and I won't even take that long. I just want to know, right, what kind of work do you guys usually take on though?
Speaker C (01:00 - 01:07): No, I didn't understand because do you want to stack up job? I don't know, stucco work only.
Speaker B (01:07 - 01:11): Do you do also paintings, repairs or installations as a handyman?
Speaker C (01:11 - 01:21): I do paint, like, you know, I do paintings inside, not inside, exterior, outside, washing. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B (01:21 - 01:25): All right. And how do you get new customers contact?
Speaker C (01:27 - 01:32): I have my referrals, my bank, I have my jobs now. I'm busy.
Speaker B (01:32 - 01:37): All right. I think Japanese, you know, you're seeing you have a lot of clients right now at the moment. Are you guys fucked up for the next six months?
Speaker D (01:37 - 01:38): Maybe. I don't know.
Speaker B (01:39 - 01:40): I'm sorry, sir, I'm speaking with business.
Speaker C (01:41 - 01:44): Guys, contractors, doesn't matter. Everything right now.
Speaker B (01:44 - 01:53): Oh, perfect. Sure. Yeah. So let's say about the same. Use 10 shukron a month, Mr. Jagros, how many of those would you expect into business with or work with out of 10 leads?
Speaker C (01:53 - 01:53): Fire.
Speaker B (01:53 - 02:28): Perfect. Okay. Yeah. So that's what we do. So we do lead generation, right? We've been in business since 2007 with 70,000 clients covering Canada and US. And what we do here is that we run ads or programs where we qualify exclusive leads for your business. So these are leads that we send out to you directly via messenger, text message or email, which is seven days and a half. We can be 20 leads, 30 leads, 50 leads, or are a minimum of 10 after they leave. Okay. The beautiful thing about the program Drag Roast is that our goal here is that you don't only get an roi, but since these are still too big for your business and you're not sure.
Speaker C (02:28 - 02:34): Oh, thank you. I don't want to snow. No, no. I driving to car after I called you back.
Speaker B (02:34 - 02:42): Okay, I understand what you're having a tough time. Are you able to put me on speakerphone? That way you can hear me out. You have been picked from this conference.

Speaker D (02:07 - 02:07): Okay.
Speaker B (02:07 - 03:13): Okay, perfect. Look, so how it works nowadays, Anthony, is that over 80% of the people that go online, whether they want to get clothing, food, or in this case your junk removal services, they use Google all the time. Right. This is where we come in and help out because we have studied the market around your area. As I mentioned to you earlier, we're 411 locals and we're one of the largest SEO companies in the country. We're actually one of the handful of certified Google partners worldwide. And we do have a four star rating. Google itself, we have helped here, Anthony, over 70,000 customers and counting. And they stay with us year in and year out. Not because they have to, but obviously because they're making money. Right. By working with our company. I do like to highlight that you guys wouldn't pay any commissions or percentages, meaning you guys get 100% profit. Right. Of whatever jobs you get done. My company also here specializes in watching what people are looking online. And there has been an increase in search traffic for this type of services. That's what we're calling you today. What we'll do here, Anthony, is actually build you guys a complete online presence that covers any way a new customer will look for you online. Right.

You do like junk removal basically. Is that what you do?
Speaker A (01:03 - 01:20): Not necessarily junk. I do some of that, I do do some of that. But a lot of what I do is estate clean outs where people want to sell items and things like that. But sometimes I do junk removal as well. It just depends on the situation.
Speaker C (01:20 - 01:28): Right, right, right. Okay, okay, that makes sense. So you have been working with this industry for about 20 years, right? With your own company?

Speaker C (02:08 - 02:24): No problem, no problem. So what we do here, my goal is actually help businesses like yours to get more visibility online, more online presence. Right. And obviously more traffic for new clients through marketing services. Is that something that you might be interested in?
Speaker A (02:25 - 02:34): Not at this time. Because I don't know who you are and I don't know your track record and I don't trust that you would provide those services because I have no idea who I'm even talking to.
Speaker C (02:34 - 02:53): That's definitely. Yeah, you're definitely correct. Right. You don't know us. We call you out of the blue, but we can definitely go ahead and present you all that. And you can even look us up. Right. Would that change a little bit of the situation here with the call? If you can look us up on Google or any other browser?
Speaker A (02:53 - 02:59): I mean, maybe. But I'm getting ready to go in the gym, and I'll get going, so.
