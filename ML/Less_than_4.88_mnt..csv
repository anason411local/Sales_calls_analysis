Oh, so you give an estimate like, like over the phone like pictures or videos or do you would have to see the entire job first? Which is that's Um, sometimes it it it all depends.

Porque buscamos un negocio que quisiera tomar mÃƒÂ¡s clientes, este, retomando este, creo que usted habÃƒÂ­a hablado con nosotros ya hace tiempecito, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
Con Samuel.
Hace como algunos meses, Ã‚Â¿verdad?
No se si se acuerda que le habÃƒÂ­amos ofrecido una promociÃƒÂ³n en lÃƒÂ­nea Vanessa para promocionar su compaÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ­a de limpieza.
Eh eh eh disculpe, eh ahora yo estoy terminando una casa y ya vamos a salir y serÃƒÂ¡ que me puedes volver a llamar maÃƒÂ±ana porque estoy ya acabando la casa para salir.

Este, de hecho, pues eh.
Pero yo creo que por ahora no, porque yo voy a salir de viaje.
Entonces voy a demorar en regresar.
SÃƒÂ­, yo quiero despuÃƒÂ©s de viajar, organizarme bien y todo eso y pues ahora no estoy interesada en eso.
No se preocupe.
Usted va a irse de vacaciones que hay que disfrutar, Ã‚Â¿sÃƒÂ­ o no?

Speaker A (00:58 - 01:54): This way, Robert, for how long have you been running this business on your own? Yeah, four years. And then on these four years at Lenini Delay, the way that you manage to get new customers for you or the way that new prospects can be able to find you, how you do it, by the recommendations, the word of mouth. You can do business cards, suppliers, your website. Tell me how you do it. Oh, oh, sounds good. You charge it for Lee? You sell Lee or no, I didn't have it. No, not like Tupa Enghi. Nothing there. No, no, nothing like that. Don't worry, we have nothing to see with this. Yeah, also that company is qualified as one of us. But no worries, we never need to be. Nothing like that. But just me. So the way that you manage to get new customers for you are how new process will be able to find you, how useful?

Speaker C (02:00 - 02:24): Oh, wow. Okay. Server complete, man. All right. No, I don't need to spend a few times here. The reason I was asking you this. We specialize what's in the traffic search terms and Internet and winning for people fixing up handyman services in the area right there. Pretty much what we want to do for you and offer you is told you complete online presence online so people are able to find you and call you directly. All right. Is that something you've been interested in?
Speaker B (02:24 - 02:32): I Mean, the way things are going right now, I'm just, I mean I don't pay for no advertisement now. I just turned to work.
Speaker C (02:32 - 03:47): Yeah, okay. That's because of the quality work service we provide, sir. And we're not here to change it, right? We're just here to, you know, increase your value through online presence so you can have a little more conversion rate, more productivity as something extra. I don't like the tons of phone, tons of customers either, right. It will get to something extra to the point where you say it was worth doing it. Right. But it's also going in specific directions. You can have a place where to give reviews and people see the work you do. I know you mentioned earlier, right? You have a good presence of people calling you back because you have good quality work, people recommend you a lot. So if you were to do something like Peter and ya, I'm pretty sure I will spot rock you the size of limit for you because basically you've been doing this for 10 years already and you haven't needed none of this, right? Imagine when you actually try to get customers, extra customers, it'll be something good for you, right? Think about Walmart's journey. Walmart, you know they're everywhere, right? Not just because they need it, because you know, they've been doing it for like a long time, right? The branding and everything, right? So I'm not going to say you're going to be the Walmart or handyman spot, you won't get some, right? That's our goal, man. I mean if it's not today, in the future then we'll text all of our information. That way you know, you can look us up and you know, you, you guys are unbooked, you have a snowman. We would love to work with you guys.
Speaker B (03:47 - 03:51): Yeah, send me a text with the info, some fasting if you don't care.
Speaker C (03:51 - 03:59): Yes sir. I just text you. There you go. If anything, just let us know. My name is Benjamin. Call back and last name please. Man, definitely love to work with you.
Speaker B (03:59 - 04:01): That sounds great. I appreciate you buddy.
Speaker C (04:02 - 04:05): You too man. Have a week. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.
Speaker B (04:05 - 04:06): Hey, you too, buddy.

Hello?
Hello, hi. Maybe you can help me.
You still do or offer handyman services?
Mass is on?
This is Ian Mitchell.
I'm actually with 411 Locals.
Maybe you can help me here because there are several people online who are looking for someone who offer handyman services.
And so my manager basically asked me to, well, look for someone who can still handle new client or new customer.
I would also like to ask if you can, uh, go ahead.
I'm not interested, thank you.
Well, if you could just hear us out because there are a significant number of interested people, sir, who are looking for someone to offer handyman services.
And as what I mentioned, my manager asked me to look for someone who can handle new client.
Since we are a company, sir, who specialize in watching and monitoring the online traffic search terms in every local area.
So, and we're trying to reach out to reliable business that we can work with who can provide quality work and will be able to handle new customers.
So we can connect those people to a business like yours who do offer free, um, handyman services.
So what are you, what are you trying to do?
Um, so on my end, since you do handyman services, sir, would you be able to cover residential and commercial work?
Hello?
Who are you with?
It's 411 Locals.
I'm with 411 Locals, sir.
Okay, how much does this cost?
So first of all, sir, regarding with the question, I do have a rough, um, pricing on my end, but we do have a program that is designed to pay per self by providing a certain business a full brand exposure.
We are basically a company responsible for building a complete online presence that covers any way a new customer would look for you online.
So just imagine this, if at any time a customer or a client searches in Google by typing a keyword like handyman services in Gulf Shores, we make sure that they see your business details, like your business name, your phone number, and if you already have a website, that will be included and that will be in front and center above your competition.
Well, not just being in front and center above your competition, but you'll be in the top place in first page of Google, sir.
Okay.
And again, sir, do you offer or provide free estimates regarding handyman services?
Yes.
All right, perfect.
And for me to address you properly, sir, again my name is Ian.
If you don't mind me asking your first name?
Uh, Casey.
Casey.
And you must be the owner, Casey?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Pleased to speak with you, Casey.
All right, just a second.
You can do residential and commercial work.
And as a handyman, Casey, do you have a crew that you work with or help you out or are you only doing this on your own?
You do have a crew.
I got a crew.
Okay.
And the phone number that I have here, this will be the only and best phone number you have for the business, or there's an alternative phone number, Casey, aside from this one?
That's the only phone number I have.
This is the best phone number.
Okay.
How about business hours, Casey?
Are you mainly work or typically work from Monday to Friday or weekends as well?
Uh, Monday to Friday.
So that will be Monday to Friday.
Okay.
All right.
All right, so Casey, as what I mentioned, I do have my manager who asked me to reach out.
Um, Ismail, you'll be speaking to Casey.
They do offer handyman services.

Speaker A (00:43 - 00:47): Right, right. Do you have a minimum charge for each job, Jerrell?
Speaker B (00:47 - 00:50): Oh, it just really depends what kind of job and how big the job is.
Speaker C (00:51 - 00:54): It depends on your job, if things applied differently.
Speaker B (00:54 - 00:56): But definitely you accept small to big jobs, right?
Speaker A (00:57 - 00:58): That's for sure.
Speaker C (00:58 - 01:03): Yeah, I'm able to handle at the moment.
Speaker B (01:04 - 01:08): So which areas are the most profitable of that for your job?

Speaker C (01:36 - 01:37): I have 5,000.
Speaker A (01:39 - 01:40): So if I were to send you.

Speaker B (01:48 - 01:52): Leads in a month, how many would you be able to close or to accommodate?
Speaker C (01:52 - 01:59): It's going to depend on each job. Besides, the size of each job is going to determine how long I'm going to take with each job.
