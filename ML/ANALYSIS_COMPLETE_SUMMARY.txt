KEY INSIGHTS FOR YOUR RESEARCH REPORT
===================================================================================

1. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS ARE CRITICAL:
   - Total discovery questions, goal1_questions, and goal2_questions all rank in top 10
   - Agents who ask more questions keep prospects engaged longer
   - Recommendation: Train agents on discovery question frameworks

2. CONVERSATIONAL ENGAGEMENT MATTERS:
   - Extended monologues, long monologues, and medium monologues all significant
   - Longer speaking segments indicate deeper engagement
   - Not about agent talking more, but about quality dialogue

3. BUYING SIGNALS PREDICT ENGAGEMENT:
   - Total buying signals shows 1018% increase in long calls
   - Agents detecting/eliciting buying signals keep prospects on the line
   - Recommendation: Train agents to recognize and amplify buying signals

4. CALL STRUCTURE DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY:
   - Time in final stage, script adherence, discovery quality all significant
   - Long calls follow better structure and process
   - Recommendation: Implement structured call frameworks

5. SENTIMENT PROGRESSION MATTERS:
   - Multiple sentiment variables (late_middle, early_middle, closing) significant
   - Long calls maintain better sentiment throughout
   - Recommendation: Focus on sentiment management training
