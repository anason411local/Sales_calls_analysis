================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================================
Shape:
  - Skewness:               2.2616 (Highly Right-Skewed)
  - Kurtosis:               6.1565 (Heavy-Tailed Distribution)

Interpretation:
  The distribution is POSITIVELY SKEWED (right-skewed), meaning:
  - Most calls are shorter in duration
  - There's a long tail of longer calls
  - Mean > Median (483.29s > 293.00s), confirming right skew
  - The distribution is NOT perfectly normal/Gaussian

Normality:
  - The Q-Q plot shows deviation from normality, especially in the tails
  - The distribution has heavier tails than a normal distribution
  - This is typical for call duration data

================================================================================
CALL DURATION CATEGORIES
================================================================================
Very Short (<1 min):        101 calls (8.3%)
Short (1-3 min):            307 calls (25.1%)
Medium (3-5 min):           211 calls (17.3%)
Long (5-10 min):            289 calls (23.7%)
Very Long (>10 min):        321 calls (26.3%)

Key Insights:
  - 33.4% of calls are under 3 minutes
  - 50.0% of calls are over 5 minutes
  - 26.3% of calls exceed 10 minutes
  - The longest category (Very Long) has the most calls

================================================================================
OUTLIER ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Outlier Detection Method: IQR Method (1.5 × IQR)
  - Lower Bound:            Q1 - 1.5×IQR = -586.50 seconds (no lower outliers)
  - Upper Bound:            Q3 + 1.5×IQR = 1,337.50 seconds

Outliers Identified:        96 calls (7.9% of total)
Normal Data:                1,125 calls (92.1% of total)

Interpretation:
  - 7.9% of calls are unusually long (>22.3 minutes)
  - These may represent complex customer interactions
  - Consider investigating these long calls for quality assurance

================================================================================
KEY BUSINESS INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. TYPICAL CALL DURATION:
   - The median call duration is 4.88 minutes
   - 50% of calls fall between 2.25 and 10.27 minutes
   - This suggests most OMC agents spend 3-10 minutes per call

2. CALL EFFICIENCY:
   - 8.3% of calls are very short (<1 min) - possible quick hang-ups or transfers
   - 25.1% of calls are short (1-3 min) - quick inquiries or rejections
   - 67% of calls are 3+ minutes - substantial customer engagement

3. LONG CALLS:
   - 26.3% of calls exceed 10 minutes
   - Some calls go up to 60 minutes (1 hour)
   - These long calls may indicate:
     * Complex customer needs
     * Detailed product explanations
     * Potential sales opportunities
     * Training needs for efficiency

4. DISTRIBUTION PATTERN:
   - The right-skewed distribution is NORMAL for sales calls
   - Most calls are quick, but some require extended time
   - The heavy tail suggests occasional very complex interactions

5. QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Very short calls (<1 min): May need investigation for premature disconnects
   - Very long calls (>30 min): May need review for efficiency opportunities
   - Sweet spot appears to be 3-10 minutes (40.9% of calls)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING:
   - Use median (4.88 min) as the benchmark for typical call duration
   - Monitor agents who consistently deviate from this benchmark

2. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Analyze very long calls (>30 min) for training opportunities
   - Review very short calls (<1 min) for potential issues

3. RESOURCE PLANNING:
   - Plan for average call duration of ~8 minutes when forecasting
   - Account for variability (±9 minutes standard deviation)

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
   - Focus QA efforts on outlier calls (7.9% of calls)
   - Review calls in the 95th+ percentile (>26.8 min)

5. FURTHER ANALYSIS:
   - Correlate call duration with conversion rates
   - Analyze duration by time of day, day of week
   - Compare duration across different agents/campaigns
   - Investigate if longer calls lead to better outcomes
