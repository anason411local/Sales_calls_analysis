He's calling that the owner of painting services so he can accommodate new customers.
Ah, sure, thank you.
Hi J, good morning.
How are you?
Hello.
I'm okay, and you?
I'm doing fantastic.
It's Monday, so better be good, right?
Well, uh, J, this is Johnson.
Uh, thank you so much for reaching us back again.
Um, actually, one of the senior area managers here in 411 locals.
I did try to call you earlier because we're currently seeing several people in your local area who are currently searching and looking for your services right now.
And pretty much we're looking for a refutable handyman that we can actually feature in front of those interested people.
So just wanted to ask you a few questions to make sure you would be a good fit, okay?
Okay.
Uh, J, you are the owner of the business, correct?
Yes.
I'm self-employed, yeah.
Perfect.
And J, can you please tell me more about your business?
Like how long have you been running your own business now?
And what, when you do get new customers, what type of jobs right now usually you want more of or what makes you the most money?
Well, the most jobs I would know is like in between painting, carpentry, and drywall, hanging drywall and painting.
Mm-hmm.
And how long have you been running the business now?
I've been doing this for about 15, 20, almost 20 years now.
Oh, wow.
Congratulations.
So pretty much I'm speaking with an expert then, I would say, right?
Yes.
Perfect.
And I do, um, I do some, I do small, small plumbing and electric too.
Just, just my, Okay. the basic, the basic electric and plumbing work.
All right, perfect.
That's good to hear.
And, uh, are you mainly doing it residentially or you're also open to do commercial jobs as well?
I do, I do mostly, mostly private, but I could do, I do commercial whenever, whenever available.
All right, perfect, perfect.
And so far so good.
Um, how far are you willing to travel for jobs or how many mile radius are we looking at?
It, it go, it depend on how, how soon I'm contacted.
I could go to Falls Church, Virginia, Maryland, Clinton, any, any, any, any, any part in the DMV, any area, long, long as I'm contact, long as I have the information in advance, as long as I'm contacted, you know, in a timely matter where I could get to these places.
Because like I said, I'm in the district, I'm in DC.
Mhm.
I live in the district.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Oh, wow.
So pretty much you can travel where the money is, I would say, right?
Yeah.
All right.
That's perfect.
Yes.
I see.
But the business is, uh, originally located in what city and zip code again?
Washington, DC.
Uh-huh, and what's the zip code?
20019.
19.
Okay, thank you.
And so far so good, J.
I'm pretty sure you're still open to take on more jobs for your business, correct?
Yes.
I see.
Well, here's the thing, J.
The reason why I ask you that question is because again, like what I told you, we've been seeing a lot of people in your local area, specifically in Washington, DC, in the city of Washington, DC, that are currently looking for handyman services, most importantly for painting, carpenter and drywall.
And actually in the past 30 days alone, out of that 574,000 population in Washington, DC, there is already a total of 38,238 total monthly search in the past 30 days alone, currently searching and looking for a refutable handyman.
So if I could put your business in front of those interested people, searching and looking for your services, that would be something very, very beneficial, right?
Okay.
Yes.
I see.
Uh, so far so good, J.
I'm just curious to know, you mentioned you've been this, uh, this business for a long time now, but how do most of your customers usually find you?
Is it online or just word of mouth?
They can find me online and then and then they pass word word to mouth.
They pass it on to other people throughout, um, throughout the region.
That's how I've been getting business.
I see.
That's great to hear.
So pretty much that speaks to the quality of your work and that's one of the things that we're looking for someone who provides handyman service in Washington.
Here's what we do, J.
When people search online for handyman services in the city of Washington, DC, they usually don't type in the business name.
They just search for the service, like painter near me, or the best carpenter, or drywall services here in Washington, DC.
Right.
Okay.
Right?
And if you're not showing up, I understand. your competitors are getting those phone calls.
Have you ever heard about VanDam handyman LLC?
Do you know them?
No.
Um, how about Handyman of DC One LLC?
Does it ring a bell?
That bring a bell.
I see.
Maybe you also haven't heard about Clappinberger and Son and Capital Hill Handyman Solutions.
Does that also ring a bell?
No.
No.
I haven't, I haven't heard of that.
But I think I've seen it online before somewhere.
I see.
Well you see, J, uh, these are actually, Sorry?
I'm listening.
I'm listening.
Go ahead.
Right.
Sorry to interrupt you, J.
Now, you see, J, I don't want you to mind them, but why this matters is because these are actually the businesses that are getting now the big checks out of those already interested people looking for painter, carpenter or drywall contractor.
It's not because they're better than you, J, but obviously speaking it's because they are more visible and easy to be found online.
Right.
Uh, you know, you see since the COVID pandemic had happened, almost 84% of people nowadays don't usually talk to their neighborhoods anymore when they're looking for something.
That's right.
They will just pull up their phone, go online and find what they wanted to buy.
And those people are now getting and dominating the area.
You know, that's the tough part, J.
You may be the best option for customers, but if they can't find you, they will just jump off and pure competitors are getting those phone calls.
And that is the reason why we're here, J, because what we do here at 411 Locals is to make sure that your business shows up any time of the day in front of those customers, so the calls and the jobs comes to you instead of someone else.
And I'm pretty sure that would be something that will be beneficial for your business, right J?
Right.
Yes.
Right.
Um, what's the name of your business, J?
I don't have no real big name or nothing like that.
Just, just, just J hand, just J the handyman.
Right.
J the handyman.
I see.
Okay, that's a good name already.
All right, not a problem.
Well, J, I don't know, I don't know if you've heard about our business before, but our company is called 411 Locals.
We're actually one of the fastest growing full-fledged advertising companies in the country.
Uh-huh.
We are also a certified Google partners.
We have a four star rating on Google.
And J, I'm not bragging, but we have helped over 70,000 business owners, small to medium sized business owners like yours.
Wait a minute.
what is 411.
I'm, I'm, I didn't mean to cut you off.
What is 411 lookout?
And most of them are what is this 411?
Oh, no.
411 Look.
I know.
Let me send you our website.
Is this number textable?
You can receive a text message?
Yes.
Yeah, let me send it to you, sir.
That's our official website and our certification coming from you, Google.
You got it?
Okay.
Uh, did you receive it?
Okay.
I got 702291.
Yeah.
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah, that's the our official website and our Google partner badge.
You can put me in speaker phone while you're, you're opening those links, but pretty much what, again, we will do the marketing for you.
So really all you got to do here, J, is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
And I'm pretty sure you can do that, right?
Correct?
Right.
Yes.
Now, the first thing that we will do here, J, is the most important part, which is to put your business on the front page placement on Google under five of your services that you mainly provide.
Let me ask you this, J.
Okay.
When was the last time you used Google to search for something?
Oh, it's been a while.
Right.
But it's been a while.
But when you use Google, were you able to find what you're looking for?
Most of the time, yes.
Right.
Well, it's because J, Google is the money maker.
Well, based on his researchers and studies, Right, exactly.
84% of people nowadays are using Google.
And here's the kicker, J.
94% of those people don't even past the first page results.
Right.
I don't know if they go to the 10th page or the bottom page of Google, but when I'm looking for something, I go directly that is the one that is highly suggested on the front page.
And that's the reason why we're putting you on there.
Because once you are on the front page of Google, J, you are naturally going to get calls since people associate the businesses on the first page as being the best anyway.
J, do you have some photos of jobs you did?
Uh, before and after photos?
I have them back at the house with my other phone.
I have, yeah, I have a lot of photos.
That's perfect.
Then it's time for you to show it to your customers because those photos is really important to build credibility of the works of the quality of the jobs that you did.
I actually sent you another link to your phone, J, that should be a sample website that I created for your business.
Do you have a website already or not yet?
No, I have, I just have my email and my messages.
You know what?
Can, can you all please, can I, can you do me a favor?
Because I'm in the dentist right now, he just called me.
I'm getting my, um, dentures put in.
Can I, can I, can you call me back about 4:00?
Is that a good time?
I can always, Uh, I can always call you back, J.
That's not going to be a problem, but I'm already done here.
Just wanted to wrap it all so you would have the information regarding everything.
Let me just wrap it all.
Okay, yes, because I'm getting these dentures put in now.
Okay.
I'm listening.
Okay.
Just give me, all right, perfect.
Now, if you could open the link that I sent you right now, J, that should be a sample website, the one that has your phone number, and then you will be routed to a sample website that I created for your business.
You got it open?
You got the link?
I don't have the link.
Let me see.
The one that has your phone number, 411 locals.com/your phone number.
From the same phone number.
Yes, I'm trying to go back there.
I see the text and, uh, let me see.
While you're finding it, J, you can still hear me, correct?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Right.
So pretty much it's, um, again, that website is pretty much customizable based on your preferences.
So if you want to change the colors, if you have some photos that you said you have, then we can actually attach that on the website to make it more enticing so that we can put your best foot forward from your business competition.
And then lastly, Okay.
We guarantee you a full brand maximum explosion.
Okay.
what you got.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
Let's see what you got.
The official website 411 locals.
Google partner.
Okay.
Tapp.
And you did it.
I'm trying to load it now.
I'm trying to load it now.
It said there are many ver, veritables 411 locals.com.
Yeah.
And then, uh, what do you see on the screen?
I see there are many ver, pages and long.
You see the name of your business, J the handyman?
Give free consultation.
Now she's calling me now.
Oh yeah, I see the handyman.
I just don't see my name.
Oh yeah, I see it.
I see J the handyman.
On the top.
Yeah.
Yes.
Do you like it or you don't like it?
You can scroll down for you to see it more.
Yeah.
I like that.
Right.
Okay, perfect.
Now again, um, just let us know what are the modifications that you want us to do here, change the color.
If you have some photos, we can put it on the gallery of photos of the before and after jobs to make it more, um, enticing and professionally done, okay?
And then lastly, J, we guarantee you a full brand maximum exposure online and that is one of the reason why we're also going to be putting your business over 50 online directories.
Okay.
We will put you on Yelp, Manta, Merchant Circle, Super Pages, Yahoo, Bing, Craigslist, basically anywhere online.
And you don't need to pay them separately.
Why?
It's because we want to make sure that wherever the customer would search and look for the services that you specialize and you do, we will make sure that you're going to be showing up there front and center your competition.
All right.
And now, J, out of the three services I mentioned, the Google, the website, or putting your business under 50 online platforms, which one do you think would benefit your business the most?
I guess the Google.
Exactly.
Yes, Google is the the key to success because the higher your Google placement is, the higher recommendation that you would have.
But again, as you can see, J, we use all this following elements that I just mentioned because, uh, to help you establish and maintain a strong online presence, which is so critical these days.
And our ability to generate new customer is why 99% of them really are happy with the results they see.
Now, it's almost impossible not to make money with this program, J, because remember, we reposition your business in front of those interested people who are already searching for your services.
The problem is that they just don't know who you are, right?
J, can you open the last link, uh, the link that says, uh, Google partners?
You got it?
Right.
The Google partner badge, the one with with along with the official website.
Just wanted to show you something.
You got that, right?
I'm trying to find it.
Contact information.
Yes, no, I'm still.
No, just go back to your text message and then you can see there the official website and then Google partner badge.
And then I want you to click the one that says google.com.
I see, I see Google partners badge.
You said click that one?
Or would you like me to send it again to you?
Yeah, you click the link and then you will be routed to a Google website.
Let me know once you're there.
Okay, I'm here.
And what do you see on the screen?
Can you read something for me?
It's kind of small.
Let me see.
Let me large it.
Um.
You got preference then certifications.
Right.
Mhm.
That's correct.
Google Google partners.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Google partners.
Right.
Now, if you can see on the link, I'm looking.
I'm looking.
No, no, no.
Just don't click the, just don't click the link.
Just let it there, okay?
Now, what you're seeing, J, is a Google website.
If you could see the link that you clicked in, it says google.com/partners, it's not our website, J.
It's directly coming from Google, right?
You can also see our name, 411 Locals, and we have met our requirements to be a certified Google partners.
Right.
We also maintain an optimization score of at least 70% indicating that we have set up our clients to perform well, which shows you our ability to actually help our clients consistently and identifying new growth opportunities and sustain their success on an ongoing basis.
Are you following?
Now, I'm showing you this, J, because Google would never ever associate themselves with just anyone.
Yes.
A multi-billion dollar company will never ever compromise their reputation that they built for a long time by being in partners with a non-legit company, right?
Right.
And also from those 900 SEO companies around the US, only five were given the batch.
And we are proud to say that we know exactly how to help you and your business in getting the right exposure you need that will also help you generate the right clients for your business.
So really, we will do the marketing for you, so really all you got to do here is just to pick up the phone calls and do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
And I'm pretty sure you can do that, correct?
Yes.
Correct.
Now, let me ask you this, sir.
How much do you make for one painting job right now?
I know it depends how big the job is, but what is the average cost of one job for you?
The average, like you said, depend on the room, or the house.
If it's a whole house or if it's a room, a whole house, the, the, I could, I could charge about, $2,000 depending on how many stories, how many squares, mm-hmm, okay.
Now, in what?
$2,000.
If we're talking about a $2,000 job, sir, out of the number of searchers right now, let's say if I drive you 40 customers in a month, how many do you think you could do business with if it's a $2,000 job?
Out of the 40 in one month.
40 jobs in a month?
Mhm.
For $2,000.
I could, I could get, uh, most of them done.
Right.
Can you give me a specific number, like realistically speaking?
Like for, um, depend on how many workers I have with me, how many people I got working with me.
So realistically, if it, it was me or another, me and another partner person, mhm.
About, mm.
Now, how many jobs you said?
40?
Um, yeah, 40 in a month.
If ever, if ever so.
40 jobs but how big?
You, you're not telling me how big the job.
$2,000 job.
A $2,000.
A $2,000.
$2,000?
Oh, okay.
Well, about half of it.
I say about half.
All right, 20.
Okay.
That's a good number already.
Now, If we're talking about $2,000 job multiplied by 20, roughly estimation, you make $40,000.
$40,000.
From the exposure we give you, right?
And I'm pretty sure, J, you wouldn't be mad at me.
You're making at least $40,000 every month if you make 20 customers, uh, you wouldn't be mad at me.
And plus you're getting constant flow of new customers calling you every time they need something done.
You wouldn't be mad at me, right?
Yeah, that's definitely, but that's not, that's not, that's not, I would be mad at you, but that's not 100% guaranteed though.
Exactly.
That's not 100% guaranteed.
Exactly.
That is not 100% guaranteed, but what I'm trying to ask you here is just once you receive one single phone call, please do the best that you can do to make your customer happy.
Is that something that you can do?
I understand.
I understand, yeah.
I'm going to understand.
Right.
Now, let's say for example you make $40,000 from the exposure we give you.
If I'm going to charge you $600 a month and you're earning $40,000, that should already cover more than the cost of the service and gives you a constant flow of new customers every time they need something done, correct?
Right, right.
Right.
But of course, I'm not going to ask you to pay $600 a month, J, because normally the price of the package that I'm presenting to you from other companies who will offer you this kind of service, it will range from 700 to 1,000 bucks.
But we are giving you a huge discount because we want to earn your business the old fashioned way, which is to show you first results.
I appreciate that.
So that's one of the reason why, Of course.
So with us, for the maintenance fee every month, regardless how much you're making, or regardless how many jobs you get, it's all yours.
We're not going to be asking for any cuts or any commission.
For you to maintain the program instead of $700, it will be only $485.98 flat rate.
But then again, I'm not going to ask you to pay today.
$485.
Yeah, $485.98.
But then again, J, I'm not going to ask you to pay that today.
Remember, we want to earn your business the old fashioned way, which is to show you results, and that's the reason why that monthly payment will start 30 days from today.
To be exact, your billing cycle will be every the 10th of every month, starting on January 10th, and we'll be auto-built as your monthly recurring fee.
But today, J, believe it or not, today you will have to, I have to, I have to, I have to lay down and think about this, okay?
I understand.
And plus, I'm in the dentist right now.
That's why I need you to call me back about 4:00.
I have to get this dentures in my mouth.
But, um, Can I think about this?
Uh, yes, but I'm not yet, uh, finished though.
You know, today I'm only giving you $59.98.
I have to, I have to, I have to.
Oh, okay.
Wow, can't beat that.
Yeah.
But I have to, I have to see this business.
I have, they're calling me now.
I can't miss this.
Can you please, can I have you call me back?
I'm in the dentist office right now.
Yeah, if I call you back later, would you, are you going to pick up the phone or not?
What time can I call you?
Oh yeah, I have to pick it up.
Okay.
Cuz that means I hear some more about this.
About 4:00.
Mm-hmm, is there something that you would like, uh, how likely you would like to proceed with this program?
Um, so interesting.
I need to hear some more though.
I'm sorry?
That's what I need to.
So I would need to hear some more about this company.
That's why I need you to call me back.
What do you want to hear from us then?
Uh, more about the prices.
You were saying this is, is, is, you have a better discount, right?
Yep.
It is.
That's what I can't concentrate right now.
I'm these people fooling with my dog on teeth.
I, you have to call me back at 4:00 because I can't concentrate right now, okay?
I appreciate that.
Just level with me right now if you're not interested or not because if you ask me to call you back, I'll be calling you back until the end of the day here, J.
Okay.
You're calling me back until the end of the day?
Because I spoke with a lot of business owners, J.
They told me to call back, but I never received any of their responses.
So I just want to be sure we are on the same page right now.
Okay.
We're on the same page.
Because my job here is not to.
You said $485 a month for your fee, right?
For your services?
Right, but today you can already start the program.
Exactly.
But for you to get everything started today, it's only going to be $59.98.
Well, just $59 now.
Right.
That's the setup fee to get everything started.
One of the reason why it's only 59.98 today so that at least we can show you results first.
This is a month to month.
We are performance-based company.
So basically the concept we want you to make is which is for you to make money first before we do.
Does that make sense?
It does.
Bottom line is once you are making profit out of the program, obviously you'd stay.
When you stay, then that's how we make money.
So really, all I'm going to be asking from you here is just give me 1% and let me earn the 99% all throughout the process.
Okay, I understand what you're saying.
I have to, I have to think about this.
Okay, that's what I'm, I'm asking you to give me time to think about this also because right now I can't make up my mind.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
In a scale of 1 to 10 right now, how likely would you would like to proceed with this program?
Uh, about six.
How can I make it to 10, sir?
I have to think about it.
That's what I said.
Let me finish with this dentist supporting.
Okay.
And do what I'm doing in here.
Okay, bye-bye.
Okay, then I'll call you at 4:00.
Bye.

Well, Robert, let me first of all introduce myself again. As my assistant said, my name is Ismael, I'm a manager of my company that is 411 local. And the reason that I asked to contact me with you is because. Well, I'm looking for a person with a reliable business that does remodeling on the area because there's a great increase on the demand of clients that are looking for this service. So what I would like to do is to see the way that we can just work together and that we can put you in front of all of this because, well, as you know, imagine if there are 1500 customers looking for this service every month between residential and commercial and you can be there for all of them. That will be as much.

Speaker A (00:58 - 01:54): This way, Robert, for how long have you been running this business on your own? Yeah, four years. And then on these four years at Lenini Delay, the way that you manage to get new customers for you or the way that new prospects can be able to find you, how you do it, by the recommendations, the word of mouth. You can do business cards, suppliers, your website. Tell me how you do it. Oh, oh, sounds good. You charge it for Lee? You sell Lee or no, I didn't have it. No, not like Tupa Enghi. Nothing there. No, no, nothing like that. Don't worry, we have nothing to see with this. Yeah, also that company is qualified as one of us. But no worries, we never need to be. Nothing like that. But just me. So the way that you manage to get new customers for you are how new process will be able to find you, how useful? Or just let me ask you something, Robert, so if I can continue this in Spanish, it will be better for you or you would like to. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Robert? Hello?

In fact, for the past 30 days in the area for pressure washing, there's about 865 number of searches from people that are looking for your type of service. They just can't find you yet. That's why they cannot reach you. If I can put your company right in front of these customers who are already interested and are already looking for the service, for sure that will be very beneficial for the company, right?

Speaker A (03:51 - 03:52): No.
Speaker C (03:53 - 04:18): Well, to be honest, I don't know them. I'm just asking because these are the companies right now in the area that I'm seeing on the first page getting the phone call and I don't see your company name here yet. That's why we called you, because we want to put your name front and center above them. That way customers can reach you directly. Especially today, over 80% of people are going online to look for what they need, even clothing.
Speaker A (04:18 - 04:27): Yeah, but I have an agent working with me on all of that stuff. I'm supposed to be getting my webpage and everything designed tomorrow afternoon and stuff.
Speaker A (04:29 - 04:34): I have emailed. I just did Power Washington for Florida.
Speaker B (04:34 - 04:37): Well, that's even great, Thomas. Of course.
Speaker C (04:37 - 04:40): Adam, I'm not here to change whatever you have, whatever you could be doing.
Speaker B (04:41 - 04:42): Just for you to really see and.
Speaker C (04:42 - 04:47): Then compare of what we can do better here. And if you don't like it, I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
Speaker B (04:47 - 04:49): So let me tell you about Sphere.
Speaker C (04:49 - 05:46): Real quick and how exactly this works. So again, our company summit is 411Locals, one of the largest SEO companies in the country. We're one of the handful of certified Google partners worldwide. So we've been doing this for 18 years now and we've already helped over 70,000 customers. And coding, they've stayed with us year in, year out. It's not because they have to, but because they're making money and they're happy with what they're getting. So what we're going to do, we build you a complete online presence that covers any way new customers would look for online. So just imagine this. Anytime new customers would go online, when they go to Google and they search for a reliable pressure washer in the area, or if they search for a pressure washing company near me, we make sure not so much that they see your business name, your phone number and your website front and center above your competition.
Speaker B (05:46 - 05:48): So Thomas, what do you think will.
Speaker C (05:48 - 05:54): Happen if it's always your name and your phone number customers will find whenever they need the service?
Speaker A (05:54 - 05:54): Great.
Speaker C (05:55 - 06:03): What do you think will happen or what do you think they'll do if it's your name and your phone number they're gonna see you and they're gonna find whenever they need to wash in.
Speaker C (06:05 - 06:09): Okay, for sure. That will give you the opportunity to call you directly.
Speaker B (06:09 - 06:10): Right.
Speaker C (06:10 - 06:12): And that means more than right.
Speaker B (06:13 - 06:17): So how we do that for you first is we put your company on.
Speaker C (06:17 - 06:25): The first page of Google under the services you provide and the services that make you the most money. And that's what we guarantee here.
Speaker B (06:25 - 06:29): So even if customers don't know you, even if they don't know your business.
Speaker C (06:29 - 06:39): Name, but whenever they search and they type in the services or the keyword, your company automatically pops up and they will call you naturally, because they're going to see as the best.
Speaker B (06:40 - 06:42): Now, as a business owner, pretty much.
Speaker C (06:42 - 06:45): You see the value of getting reviews from your customers.
Speaker B (06:46 - 06:46): Right?
Speaker C (06:47 - 06:47): Right.
Speaker A (06:47 - 06:48): Absolutely.
Speaker C (06:48 - 06:50): So that's what you do best here.
Speaker B (06:50 - 06:52): So we're going to make it easier.
Speaker C (06:52 - 06:55): For all of your customers to be able to put reviews for you.
Speaker B (06:56 - 06:58): Now these reviews are right there on.
Speaker C (06:58 - 07:08): The first page listing. So once someone puts their view on what a great or awesome job you did, then that's an instant credibility. Then customers will choose you over your competition.
Speaker B (07:08 - 07:11): Now, since most of the customers use.
Speaker C (07:11 - 07:19): SM or tablets powered by Google, your company summits will be front and center over Google Maps and Google Voice search.
Speaker B (07:20 - 07:23): Now, part of the package is creating.
Speaker C (07:23 - 07:27): And maintaining your website. In fact, I just created you a sample, I sent it to you, but.

Speaker C (07:28 - 07:30): A website that's on process.
Speaker B (07:30 - 07:32): And Thomas, if you want to make.
Speaker C (07:32 - 07:39): It to that website. What we're going to do is create a backlink to your website to make sure that it really generates traffic to your business.
Speaker B (07:40 - 07:41): Because, you know, Asami, even if you.
Speaker C (07:41 - 07:49): Have the most beautiful website, but if customers cannot even find and cannot see it, it's not going to do you any good. Am I making sense?
Speaker A (07:49 - 07:50): Yes, I follow you.
Speaker B (07:51 - 07:54): Thank you. So that's why with our program, we.
Speaker C (07:54 - 08:09): Make sure that you have a website fully optimized and designed to be on the first page where everyone can see. Because our system knows exactly what your competitors are doing to get to the first page. And it copies those same best practices for industry.

That way they can contact you directly and they can pay directly. And you don't even have to pay each directly just to be listed in there because that's part of the package we have for you.

Speaker B (10:38 - 10:43): That's why, that's why we're not going to change that. If you want to make use of that website, we're going to create a.
Speaker C (10:43 - 10:47): Backlink to that website from us. Sub PCs can also generate traffic to your business.
Speaker B (10:47 - 10:48): So how much are you paying for.
Speaker C (10:48 - 10:50): That though, if you don't mind asking?
Speaker A (10:51 - 11:07): I paid a company to do my, get my llc, my ein number, and they got a web designer and all this stuff going on. So I'm already in the process. I, I'm, I'm just waiting for my paperwork, but they're supposed to be tomorrow. For what?
Speaker B (11:07 - 11:10): For the website alone or for everything that they've done?
Speaker A (11:11 - 11:32): It's a package, it's a package deal that I got. I, I, and they paid for my, my, I paid like 200 bucks and, and they got my, my LLC and I had a priority mail express sent. That was the next year. I got an ein, I have a website, I got an email, they send me a business card, a magnet's on my truck.
Speaker B (11:32 - 11:36): Aside from that, aside from the 200, do you pay monthly as well for.
Speaker C (11:36 - 11:41): The maintenance or it's just one time? They give you the website and then it's yours?
Speaker A (11:41 - 11:43): No, there's not. Yeah, it's mine.
Speaker C (11:43 - 11:50): There you go. So that means they're not optimizing it, they just created the website and give it to you. That's it.
Speaker B (11:50 - 11:52): Because that's how it works with some.
Speaker C (11:52 - 11:53): Other companies out there.
Speaker B (11:53 - 11:55): They create and design you a website.
Speaker C (11:56 - 11:57): Just for the sake of having a website.
Speaker B (11:58 - 12:00): But with our program here, we're not.
Speaker C (12:01 - 12:10): Going to stop by creating your website, but we optimize it. We manage and monitor everything to make sure that every time customers would search.
Speaker B (12:10 - 12:12): For the service, they don't have to.
Speaker C (12:12 - 12:25): Search for your domain, they don't have to search for your company name, but just by typing in the services or the keywords, your website, your company name, your phone number will pop up. That's how we do it for you.
Speaker A (12:25 - 12:41): All right, well, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna deal with these people tomorrow. I don't want to pay nothing out the pocket right now. I got a lot of. A lot of expenses that I've been paying the last couple days for this business, and I'm trying to get that taken care of before I make another move with another expense.
Speaker A (12:43 - 12:48): Everybody wants me to pay them to make money, but I'm not making money. You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker B (12:49 - 12:53): Well, to be honest with you, Summer, I'm not even paid with a 49.
Speaker C (12:53 - 13:06): Our company is not making money out of that. We're investing a lot on this campaign just to start with the website we're creating for you. It's not just a simple or basic website here. We're creating a website that is worth $800.
Speaker B (13:07 - 13:09): Optimizing your business on the first page of Google.
Speaker C (13:09 - 13:15): We're investing $300 for that. And then listing your business all in directories and phone book listings.
Speaker B (13:16 - 13:19): Just say you have been kicked from this conference.

Uh, we're actually looking for an electrician who would like to work out there in the area.
And uh, yeah, I suppose your base out of Tacoma, right?
Yes, sir.
Okay, very good.
I'd like to ask just a couple questions first, though, if you don't mind.
I just want to see if this is going to be a good fit, okay?
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
All right.
Like, can you tell me, sir, how long you've been in business now?
The business, about less than a year.
Less than a year.
Okay, I can see you've been doing this 20 years now, though.
Is that right?
Yeah, say pals.
Yeah, so congratulations.
I guess you got tired of working hard, making somebody else rich.
Is that right?
Yes, yes sir.
All right, very good.
Are you the sole owner or like how many owners are there?
Right now just me.
Just you.
Okay, so you typically work alone for now or do you have some employees on the team?
Me and my wife.
It's you and your wife.
Uh, the employee is yes.

Okay, can you tell me about the type of jobs you usually take on, though?
All types, commercial residential.
Okay.
Restaurant, whatever.
Yeah.
Okay.
You do uh, installs, repair, right?
Service calls, all that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, everything.
Okay.
Now, and you are you doing this full time by the way or just on the side yet?
No, full time.
Yeah.
Full time.
Okay.
Now, um, let me ask you this there because I mean sorry, uh, Hector.
Um, because we both know there's a lot, uh, there's so many electricians out there and you just started.
A lot of people may haven't heard of you yet.
What have you been doing so far to find customers to keep yourself busy?
I just uh, repeat customers, referrals.
Mhm.
Okay, of course.
You just have to keep make make sure you keep on doing a good job.
Eventually, um, you know, they're going to seek back your service and uh, even tell their friends about it, right?
Word amount.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Always the best out there.
Have you done any type of ads in the local paper, radio, TV or anything online?
No, just uh, just a website that we have and but nothing else.
Okay.
Well, see, here's actually the reason I called uh, Hector, okay?
My company 411 locals, we specialize in uh, watching traffic of search terms on the internet and we do see a significant amount of traffic going on from people searching for your service.
And if we talk about uh, Tacoma, that area alone for the past 30 days, I'm seeing here a total of over 22,908 searches from people looking for electrical services.
That's insane, right?
That's a lot of searches.
Yeah.
That is a lot.
So, yeah, imagine this Hector, somebody out there goes online to go to Google and they type in electric uh electrician near me, even if they don't know you, they're going to see your website, your company name popping up in first page of Google in front of them.
That should be very beneficial for your business, right?
Yeah, anything is uh, right now we're super, super busy.
Already.
But if I send you five jobs right now, are you going to turn them all down or how many can you take?
I have turned jobs down actually uh from the repeat customers just because we're already too busy and we got new construction going.
Okay.
I'm I'm literally stressing myself and uh, maybe like after January, after the holidays, I may may hire another crew, you know, add another crew and at least one more journeyman, competent person that can run a job.
But right now it's just myself and I I don't want to take any more jobs right now before the holidays, before the end of the year.
But after January, I'm going to start looking to that because uh, to share the workload, it won't won't hurt getting any more projects because we can um spread it out, you know, delegate a little more some jobs, then they'll be that'll make sense.
But right now, before the end of the year, I don't want to even because I already turned out jobs and I don't want to add more to my plate because I'm already full basically.
Okay.
But after January, after January beginning of February, I will go to uh do something like that, yes.
I love to follow you back place.
Okay, I guess I'll follow you back place.
But January then next month, all right?
Appreciate it.
Yeah, what's your what's your name, sir?
What's your name?
Uh, it's Darwin.
Darwin, Darwin.
That's Yeah.
All right.
Darwin.
Yeah, give me a call uh, I I want to say end of January and then by then I'll probably have something lined up another hire somebody else.
Okay.
All right.
Another another crew.
I want another crew, you know.
I got an eye on somebody, but I want to make sure they're the right fit.
So uh, another crew.
Um, right now, I don't want to even add anymore because we're already full basically turned down jobs.
Okay.
We got a couple of reconstruction jobs.
We got a couple of reconstruction jobs.
And yeah, Louis Electric calls got lower.
All night all day all night.
I I call ourselves all day all night electric right now.
I'm that makes sense, you know.
You you get yourself too busy, can't handle all those work uh coming into you, right?
So.
Right.
But yeah, you're obviously doing a good job, keeping yourself busy.
Um, appreciate you.
Yeah, yeah.
Definitely.
Take care.
Yeah, uh so end of end of January, let's check it let's look back and we'll see.
I might want to do that.

OrgÃ¡nico significa que la gente tenga que poner el nombre de su negocio en Google para encontrarlo, Â¿verdad? Ahora, la gente que busca sus servicios no pone el nombre, Â¿verdad? Pues siempre pone el servicio que busca. Por ejemplo, haga landscaping y ponga compaÃ±Ã­a de landscaping cerca de mÃ­. EstÃ¡n muchos factores. A veces puede ser que a veces no hacen los backlinks correctamente con las aplicaciones para que Google lo reconozca mÃ¡s. Dos, hay veces que pues eh si no tiene muchas reviews no le ayuda mucho. O tres, la tercera viene siendo que fue orgÃ¡nico simplemente lo que le hicieron y lo que hizo usted, Â¿verdad? Desafortunadamente, cuando vienen a una mÃ¡s experiencia y me cuentan esto es porque siempre es orgÃ¡nico. No normalmente y pues nunca tienen resultados porque pues la gente para encontrarlo siempre tiene que poner el nombre de la compaÃ±Ã­a y asÃ­ no sucede, Â¿no? O sea, la optimizaciÃ³n se toma poquito tiempo pero funciona bien ya que se requiera a a que se la optimizaciÃ³n completamente bien, Â¿okay? O sea, es lo que hacemos acÃ¡. TambiÃ©n hacemos, este, la optimizaciÃ³n eh no solamente completa en su Ã¡rea, sino que basado a lo que usted ofrece, que en este caso creo que es landscaping, Â¿no? Lo que usted se se se enfoca, Â¿verdad, seÃ±or? Especialista. Mire, mi Mire, mi mi licencia estÃ¡ para hacer todo, todo. Okay. Pero pero mi mi, mis anuncios estÃ¡n en landscaping, Facebook y todo eso, y todo lo que estÃ¡ en mis anuncios. Okay, quiero explicarle tambiÃ©n. Entonces, la la seÃ±ora que me hizo esa website me dijo que si la podÃ­a renovar. Yo no puedo renovarla, ya le dije, ""Ya la renovÃ© por, por 2 aÃ±os y no agarrÃ© ni un patrÃ³n por eso por tener esa website."" Y usted sabe que uno, uno necesita invertir, si no hay, si no hay trabajo, no hay dinero para invertir. SÃ­. SÃ­. Â¿CuÃ¡nto le cobraban ahÃ­ con la seÃ±ora esa? Ah, ella casi no me cobrÃ³ mucho, me cobrÃ³ poco. SÃ­, hace, hace 2 aÃ±os. Ya, ya ni mucho me acuerdo cuÃ¡nto me cobrÃ³, pero no me cobrÃ³ mucho. Mhm. Este, fÃ­jese que el la la cosa, la, la cosa estÃ¡ que yo necesito una persona que me ayude a agarrar clientes. Â¿SÃ­? Una, quiero ver si mi website tiene, tiene cÃ³mo apuntar mi correo electrÃ³nico. Ya de ahÃ­ se mete usted a mi pÃ¡gina ahÃ­ y va a ver. No, ya, ya la encontrÃ© ahorita. Apenas la estoy viendo. SÃ­, la pÃ¡gina estÃ¡ bonita, pues de hecho estÃ¡ bien, hasta estÃ¡ bien hecha, pues, Â¿verdad? Exacto. Pero pues, imagÃ­nese que es como si nadie la estÃ¡ viendo, pues no funciona, Â¿verdad? Entonces, es lo que estÃ¡ cayendo, Â¿verdad? FÃ­jese que todos me dicen, ""Tu la la website estÃ¡ bien hecha."" Ahora, SÃ­, estamos. hay un problema, dicen, ""Hay un problema, por quÃ© no se comunican contigo."" Entonces, otros me dicen que la el correo electrÃ³nico no estÃ¡, no estÃ¡ relatado con la website y asÃ­. PedÃ­ ayuda que me me la arreglaran, pero dice que no se puede arreglar, que hay que hacer otra de nuevo y y asÃ­. Hay que hacer otra website. Antes de que continÃºe. Mhm. En la pÃ¡gina web, no importa que su correo electrÃ³nico no tenga login ni nada. El Google My Business, es que son dos cosas para explicÃ¡rselo bien, Â¿okay? Mira, ahÃ­ le va. EstÃ¡ la pÃ¡gina web, jefe, y luego el Google My Business, el perfil de Google, para que salga en el mapa. SÃ­. Â¿Okay? AhÃ­ te va. El perfil de Google, AjÃ¡. a veces, ya ve que tiene su correo electrÃ³nico para que le hagan el estado de Google. Por ejemplo, usted para meterse en login a eso, usted tendrÃ­a que meterse en Google con el correo electrÃ³nico donde hizo usted perfil y tiene que poner en Google, tapearle Google My Business profile. Y ahÃ­ luego luego va a ver si tiene acceso o no. EstÃ¡ muy simple, jefe, Â¿okay? Y ya si hizo algÃºn caso. SÃ­, porque yo no. DÃ­game, a ver. FÃ­jese que yo no estudiÃ© computaciÃ³n, pues, no, no viera que me cuesta, este. Ah, no se preocupe. Comienzo, por eso pago para hacer eso. SÃ­, porque no, no me dieron estudio en computaciÃ³n y, este, pues yo cuando voy a las librerÃ­as a pedir favor de que me a que me ayuden a, este, a ver cuÃ¡l es el problema de la website, por quÃ© no se comunican conmigo, por eso a mÃ­ me cuesta. SÃ­. SÃ­. AjÃ¡. Ah, ya, no se preocupe. Mire, Mire. Ese perfil de Google, digamos que usted quiera la misma que tenÃ­a antes, la pura pÃ¡gina de Google, estamos hablando, no la pÃ¡gina web, Â¿okay? La pÃ¡gina de Google, Â¿okay? SÃ­. Usted tiene acceso a ese correo electrÃ³nico o ya perdiÃ³ el acceso, el login, pues, las contraseÃ±as se le olvidÃ³ o lo perdiÃ³ o algo, Â¿quÃ© pasÃ³ con eso? No, no. AquÃ­ tengo, el correo electrÃ³nico estÃ¡ bien, es que estÃ¡ Arevalo 73. Ah, okay, perfecto. Â¿Quiere, quiere, quiere, estÃ¡ usted en en mi, en mi perfil usted ahÃ­? SÃ­, estoy viendo su pÃ¡gina y perfil de Google. AhÃ­ le va, no no se precipite. Mire, lo que dice de la pÃ¡gina web ahora, que en su pÃ¡gina web sale un correo electrÃ³nico que estÃ¡ malo, eso no, eso es, no es como que sea mentira, Â¿verdad? La informaciÃ³n tiene que estar correctamente en todo, Â¿verdad? Pero no afecta nada la optimizaciÃ³n que es su correo electrÃ³nico no estÃ© bien, eso es otra cosa, Â¿okay? Lo voy a poner muy simple, se lo voy a explicar asÃ­ de la forma mÃ¡s fÃ¡cil, Â¿okay? Jefe, usted me va a entender perfectamente, Â¿okay? En Google, AjÃ¡. en Google, con que mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n tenga en lÃ­nea, mÃ¡s le va a ayudar en la optimizaciÃ³n porque Google le lo reconoce mÃ¡s usted. AhÃ­ le va. Â¿Por quÃ©? Si ahorita yo buscara Arevalo Landscaping LLC o su puro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono, ahorita estamos viendo que tiene su pÃ¡gina web y su perfil de Google nada mÃ¡s, hasta ahÃ­. Y creo que una pÃ¡gina como de red social no mÃ¡s. Â¿QuÃ© sucede ahÃ­? Usted no mÃ¡s estÃ¡ en tres partes. Â¿QuÃ© pasa aquÃ­? Nosotros tenemos que agregar algo en mÃ¡s aplicaciones y hacer eso a un backlink, como un enlace a su perfil de Google. Una. Mhm. En las aplicaciones donde te con te pongamos seÃ±or Arevalo, tenemos que poner su poner su informaciÃ³n correctamente como lo tienen en su perfil de Google. SÃ­. Para que te ayude mÃ¡s con la optimizaciÃ³n y con el ranking. Â¿CÃ³mo se llama ese proceso? Se llama situaciones en lÃ­nea. De hecho, si usted, si usted escribe ""situaciones en Google"", ""situaciones en lÃ­nea para Google My Business"", va a haber ese mismo proceso que nosotros harÃ­amos por usted para que le ayude con los ranking y optimizaciÃ³n. Eso de las palabras claves que usted diga, ""Oye, si pongo landscaping cerca de mÃ­ no aparezco, es porque no estÃ¡ optimizÃ¡ndose de esa manera y aparte porque no hay funcionamiento de palabras claves a trabajando con sus backlinks."" Entonces, es lo que se ocupa trabajar. Se la pongo muy simple. Si usted a empezar el dÃ­a de hoy con nosotros, Â¿quÃ© puede esperar por el proceso, cuÃ¡nto tiempo dura, cÃ³mo serÃ­a? Â¿Okay? AhÃ­ le va. Nosotros en el mes nÃºmero uno trabajamos con toda su plataforma, creamos el la base de todo esto para que en el primer nÃºmero uno salgan su cÃ³digo postal en su Ã¡rea. En su cÃ³digo postal sÃ­ va a poder salir en la primera pÃ¡gina. Bajo una lista de cinco palabras claves largas, que es una long tail keyword. SerÃ­an por ejemplo para usted, landscaping service near by me o cosas relacionadas a su servicio, los diga tambiÃ©n para que le funcione bien. En el segundo mes se mejora 17 palabras claves y a mÃ¡s cÃ³digos postales alrededor contigo, no en toda la ciudad, porque si tiene en cuenta que es una ciudad de grande, de de grande, de mÃ¡s de 2 millones de personas, Â¿okay? Para cubrirle toda la ciudad de Seattle, imagÃ­nese, puede tardar desde lo mÃ­nimo de 6 meses o mÃ¡ximo 1 aÃ±o o 10 meses, Â¿okay? No significa que no va a haber ningÃºn resultado, sino que simplemente lo que tarde para que tenga mÃ¡ximo resultados por la optimizaciÃ³n del anuncio para que cubra mÃ¡s Ã¡reas, Â¿okay? Pero primeramente serÃ­a su cÃ³digo postal, segundo, mÃ¡s cÃ³digos postales alrededor contigo y despuÃ©s la ciudad constantemente, Â¿okay? Pero tarde el tiempecito. La inversiÃ³n pues sÃ­ vale la pena porque pues, digamos que usted a los 6 meses llega que agarre unos cinco trabajos, pues ya valiÃ³ la pena porque no tuvo que mÃ¡s, pagan mucho y de ahÃ­ mismo se pagÃ³, Â¿verdad? AhÃ­ le va seÃ±or Arevalo. Ya. Exactamente. DÃ­game. Espere. Le voy a decir cuando ya pueda. necesario. Hay otro servicio que se llama patrocinado Google Ads, pero ese se paga a Google directamente. Ese le cobran por click. Ese si no quiere esperarse 6 meses para que estÃ© con la primera pÃ¡gina en Google todo Seattle, ese en ese sale vivo en 7 a 10 dÃ­as. Ese programa es un cobro por click. Si alguien le hiciera click a su anuncio ahÃ­ le pueden cobrar de $2.18 a mÃ¡ximo $5.19 entre eso, dependiente, dependiendo cuÃ¡l sea su industria, cuÃ¡l sea su ciudad. En ese, en ese de patrocinado, si usted quiere cubrir Seattle y otra ciudad al mismo tiempo, lo puede hacer. Â¿Por quÃ©? No se ocupa elecciÃ³n para para verificar la cuenta con Google con video. Ese directamente paga uno a Google directamente para que cubra la ciudad que usted quiera. Dos, ese viene siendo como un comercial tipo sÃ­, Â¿por quÃ©? Se puede poner a schedule. Â¿QuÃ© es un schedule? Que usted ponga que lo quiera tener de las 8 de la maÃ±ana a 5 de la tarde en vivo el anuncio y ya despuÃ©s se apaga. Una, para que su presupuesto te dure mÃ¡s y dos, para que tampoco en la noche alguien le dÃ© click y le cobren, porque en la noche quiÃ©n va a buscar su servicio, pues nadie, Â¿verdad? Pura gente que estÃ¡ buscando cosas que no, Â¿verdad? Entonces, ese se maneja mejor, es mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido, nada mÃ¡s que es una inversiÃ³n mÃ¡s agresiva, pues poquito mÃ¡s agresiva, pero si busca algo muy rÃ¡pido pues vale mÃ¡s la pena pues, porque le digo, sale en vivo casi de 7, una semana, 10 dÃ­as, depende cual agarre. Y la tercera opciÃ³n que tenemos nosotros es la de lead generation. No sÃ© si usted ha escuchado una aplicaciÃ³n que vende leads, que le vende leads, el puro cliente potencial. No. Â¿No? No. Ese nosotros prÃ¡cticamente, nosotros hacemos el anuncio, no bajo su nombre, pero en redes sociales y ese anuncio la gente llena una forma, pero preguntando informaciÃ³n de su servicio, o sea, esperando tu llamada. La gente pondrÃ¡ su nombre, nombre y el servicio que buscan. Nosotros le mandamos ese contacto usted directamente y a usted le toca hablarles, Â¿verdad? Y y y ofrecerle un estimado, con una cita. Pero ese en vez de que usted ellos hablen a usted directamente, ellos van a esperar una llamada de usted, es mÃ¡s diferente obviamente, Â¿por quÃ©? Si usted le habla a una lead, hay veces que no le contestan porque estÃ¡ en buzÃ³n de voz, estÃ¡ manejando y pues le puede fallar poquito la inversiÃ³n pues. Por eso el anuncio en Google es mejor porque ellos le hablan a usted directamente, pues sÃ­ vale mÃ¡s la pena, pero depende cual agarre tambiÃ©n, Â¿okay? SÃ­. Pero le damos las opciones, pues, Â¿verdad? Eh eh esa de tener una pÃ¡gina como la que usted tiene ahorita orgÃ¡nica, pues nosotros la tenemos muy barato y lo otro de de optimizaciÃ³n pues puede variar el precio desde los 121 a mÃ¡ximo 365, dependiendo cual sea su cÃ³digo postal, entre eso. Â¿Okay? Â¿CuÃ¡nto, si en los 6 meses, cuÃ¡nto, cuÃ¡nto me salen los 6 meses en los 6 meses? Eh. Â¿CuÃ¡l es, cuÃ¡l es el cÃ³digo postal para darle un, para decirle cuÃ¡nto, cuÃ¡nto sale en su Ã¡rea? 981 98173. Oh, solo, este, es que mire, en cada Ã¡rea hay un cÃ³digo, ese es el problema. SÃ­. Que no, no puedo yo decirle, o sea, le doy mi cÃ³digo pero es que en cada sector hay un cÃ³digo. Deme el cÃ³digo postal de la direcciÃ³n de oficina o de su negocio mÃ¡s bien en este caso. De mi negocio. Eh, donde estÃ¡ ubicado el negocio. La direcciÃ³n. No, es que yo no tengo oficina, yo solo, yo soy como los, yo soy principiante, pues, soy, estoy todavÃ­a asÃ­, este, o sea, agarrando clientes y ah, soy principiante. Okay. AhÃ­ le va. SÃ­. Entonces, serÃ­a el cÃ³digo postal de donde estÃ¡ la compaÃ±Ã­a eh de su direcciÃ³n mÃ¡s bien, acÃ¡ en su oficina, apartamento, oficina, la, el cÃ³digo postal no mÃ¡s, no la direcciÃ³n completa. El puro zip code, Â¿cuÃ¡l serÃ­a? Mi el cÃ³digo del, de todo es 98178, es de la, es del Ã¡rea. Okay. SÃ­. Es donde vive usted, Â¿verdad? PrÃ¡cticamente, Â¿verdad, eso? SÃ­. Y hay y hay, sÃ­ tiene clientes ahÃ­, jefe, sÃ­ trabaja o no tanto realmente, porque estÃ¡, estÃ¡ chiquita el Ã¡rea donde estÃ¡ usted. No, fÃ­jese que no, no, no tengo, no tengo clientes ahorita. Estoy buscando clientes, sÃ­. SÃ­, seÃ±or. Estoy buscando clientes por eso. Apenas comenzÃ³, Â¿quÃ© tiempo su compaÃ±Ã­a tiene? Ah, apenas, este, ahorita voy a cumplir 2 aÃ±os, 2 aÃ±os voy a tener. Ah, y estÃ¡ muy bien. SÃ­, 2 aÃ±os. Tal vez sÃ­ ya llevo un poquito mÃ¡s, ya llevo un poquito mÃ¡s de de 2 aÃ±os ya. SÃ­. Pienso. Okay. Pero yo lo que le digo que me hicieron es, me hicieron esa, esa este, website y no, no yo no, yo no puedo invertir porque yo no no me no me genera trabajo y no tengo dinero para invertir. Ese es el problema. Â¿SÃ­? Porque yo, mi licencia, mire, mi licencia estÃ¡ para hacer pintura, para hacer spray, para hacer este, este, para hacer este, limpiar techos, este, limpiar gares y todo eso, todo eso, hacer landscaping, tirar y echar tierra, ya, echar bark, top soil, pavers, ya, hacer hacer frame de, eh, o sea, todo esos cercas, todo es decks, SÃ­. ya, fencing, todo eso estÃ¡ en mi licencia para hacer todo eso. Mire, el anuncio, por ejemplo, es que es por temporada, ahorita que estÃ¡, creo que estÃ¡ lloviendo con usted, o hay nieve o algo, estÃ¡ frÃ­o con usted, Â¿no? El tiempo, Â¿no? O sea, estÃ¡n, estÃ¡n lloviendo y todo, Â¿verdad? O sea, todo varÃ­a, Â¿verdad? SÃ­. AquÃ­ ya llevan, Mira, aquÃ­ ya llevan 10 dÃ­as de que no ha parado la lluvia, 10 dÃ­as. SÃ­, es lo que le digo. SÃ­. ImagÃ­nese que usted anuncie correctamente y puro landscaping, pues no va a tener ningÃºn cliente porque pues no lo van a buscar, Â¿verdad? Es es por temporada tambiÃ©n, pues, eso tiene que ver muchÃ­simo, jefe. Entonces, a usted le convendrÃ­a ponerse como general contractor o como remodeling company, para que haya remodelaciones or general construction, right? Eh, ese a lo mejor fue un motor error, Â¿verdad? Pero es que fue orgÃ¡nico simplemente, es eso tambiÃ©n, Â¿verdad? Entonces, eh, se lo pongo muy simple. AjÃ¡. Si usted se pusiera como home improvement remodel or general contractor en la optimizaciÃ³n, sÃ­ le convendrÃ­a mÃ¡s porque serÃ­a puro es, para puro eso de lo que usted busca, pintura, drywall, roofing or concrete work, Â¿okay? Mhm. AjÃ¡. Es que depende a la la industria tambiÃ©n, Â¿okay? Es es, por ejemplo, si usted se registraba landscaping y haga puro trabajo de jardinerÃ­a y y estÃ© en en un lugar donde nieva, en diciembre no va a tener nada, Â¿verdad? Porque estÃ¡n, es es lo mismo, Â¿verdad? Entonces, es dependiendo del lugar tambiÃ©n. No, correcto. Para enero nieva bastante aquÃ­ en Seattle, nieva. Es lo que le digo. Nieva para enero. SÃ­. Exactamente, entonces ahÃ­ tiene que ver muchÃ­simo. Entonces, yo puedo, puedo hacer gabinetes, puedo hacer parches de chirock, puedo poner chirock, puedo tapear chirock y todo eso, puedo. Pero mi licencia solo, o sea, mi anuncio dice solo jardinerÃ­a o jardinerÃ­a y este, Este. ahÃ­, no, bueno, hay varios, hay varios Arevalo Landscaping. Yo quiero preguntarle en quÃ© Arevalo Landscaping estÃ¡ usted metido. Quiero preguntarle primero. Eh. Nosotros tenemos el sistema con el puro nÃºmero de, mira, nosotros tenemos un sistema Creo que me va a ayudar. SÃ­. para nuestros clientes, con poner el nÃºmero, el puro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono podemos encontrar su perfil de Google o su pÃ¡gina, lo que tenga o Yelp, Â¿verdad? Nosotros con el puro, el nÃºmero de telÃ©fono lo encontramos y si sale la que tiene, dÃ©jeselo mando lo que estoy viendo, Â¿okay? Para que vea que SÃ­, porque hay un montÃ³n de, hay un montÃ³n de Arevalo Landscaping. Hay muchÃ­simos. Ay, un montÃ³n. Yo sÃ©, jefe, sÃ­, sÃ­. AhÃ­ le mandÃ© mi ID. Entonces usted tiene que Yo le pregunto. SÃ­, porque si, si usted no estÃ¡ en mi pÃ¡gina, pues yo creo que no, no, usted le va a trabajar a otra persona, Â¿sÃ­? No, no, seÃ±or, no se preocupe. Mire, eh, usted tiene dos reviews en su pÃ¡gina de Google, eh, su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono 206-661-0861, es su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono usted y su pÃ¡gina web es la que tiene, este, Seattle, Washington, tiene el, el TikTok ahÃ­ conectado hasta eso y su, y tiene verde y su, y su nombre en, en amarillo anaranjado, algo asÃ­, Â¿verdad? Ah, lo tengo. Eh, pero mire, digo, todo eso. Mhm. Â¿Correo electrÃ³nico? El correo electrÃ³nico lo que, es lo que le preocupa a usted, lo que ve, Â¿verdad? Quisiera cambiarlo, me dice, Â¿ah? Dejo, checo, jefe. No, no, no. No, no lo quiero cambiar. EstÃ¡ bien el correo electrÃ³nico, nada mÃ¡s que quiero asociarlo a la pÃ¡gina web porque dice que no estÃ¡, no estÃ¡, este, es lo que me dicen. AhÃ­ le va, sale, sale, ahÃ­ le va, mira, sale Arevalo landscaping73@gmail.com. Es lo que me marca acÃ¡. SÃ­. Ese mero, ese es. Â¿SÃ­? Ah, es que mire, este, es que yo soy muy franco. Hay muchas compaÃ±Ã­as que van a ofrecerle promociÃ³n, jefe, y yo le soy muy franco, nomÃ¡s que pues hay unos que le echan una mentirÃ­a, pues, Â¿verdad? Por ejemplo, hay miles de compaÃ±Ã­as que van a llamarle, le van a decirle que son parte de Google, pero eso es mentira, ni si quiera Google le va a hablar. Lo que nosotros somos, somos una compaÃ±Ã­a que sÃ­ estÃ¡ certificada con Google. No somos Google, pero estamos certificados con ellos. Hay mÃ¡s de 1,000 compaÃ±Ã­as que ofrecen lo mismo. Le digo, la certificaciÃ³n que tenemos con Google solamente eh creo que 45 compaÃ±Ã­as la tenemos aquÃ­ en Estados Unidos. Esa que le mandÃ© es certificado, usted vÃ©alo, va a decir 411locals.com, es, tiene un rÃ©dito del 60% de definiciÃ³n para el anuncio y cumple con tÃ©rminos y condiciones para estar certificado con Google. Y sale todo el nombre ahÃ­ tambiÃ©n. De hecho, en la pÃ¡gina de Google directa, si usted se metiera certificacionescongoogle.com, va a haber 411 locals ahÃ­ tambiÃ©n, el nÃºmero de ese negocio. Eso muchas compaÃ±Ã­as no lo tienen, Â¿okay? Entonces, le voy a, le voy a contar. Mande. FÃ­jese que yo andaba, los trabajos que he agarrado es que he ido a tirar tarjetas, pero me han regaÃ±ado por tirar tarjetas. Fui a dejar tarjetas en un buzÃ³n y me dice y un seÃ±or me dijo, ""Mira, Â¿por quÃ© no haces una, por quÃ© no haces una website?"", me dijo, ""Â¿Por quÃ© no haces una website? Deja de estar tocando los buzones y hace una website"", me dijo. AsÃ­ me dijo. SÃ­, sÃ­, jefe, mire. SÃ­, pero no, mira, eso de en los, en los buzones no se puede tocar, pero sÃ­ puede ponerlo en la puerta. Eso sÃ­ se puede y yo conozco negocios de landscaping que andan en jardinerÃ­a y hasta tocan puertas, seÃ±or. SÃ­ se puede, no pueden decirle nada. Obviamente, si usted se mete a una actividad que es HOA, que es Home Association, algo asÃ­, Â¿verdad? Ya ves que los HOAs es privado, ahÃ­ sÃ­ los hasta los sacan eh la seguridad, ahÃ­ es privado, pues. Pero si es acÃ¡ pÃºblico, obviamente si la gente se enoja pues obviamente hasta la policÃ­a le va a hablar, ya ves como son, Â¿no? Pero a los que no, puede tocar hasta la puerta, no pasa nada, porque uno ya estÃ¡ registrada su compaÃ±Ã­a, tiene su su LLC, tal, usted estÃ¡ legal, pues. Hay compaÃ±Ã­as que ni siquiera tienen registraciÃ³n como usted, jefe, y ni ni aseguranza y asÃ­ andan, fÃ­jese eh. Y andan por aquÃ­ por si trabajan asÃ­, pues, pero usted anda bien, no pueden decirle nada, ni siquiera la ciudad. Creo que si usted va a la ciudad pues son permisos de nada, hasta eso, Â¿verdad? Para que no lo moleste nadie, Â¿verdad? Mire, mi licencia Manden. Mi licencia estÃ¡ para trabajar en, en residencial, comercial de residencial comercial, pero mi licencia no dice residencial comercial tampoco. No, mi licencia, yo puedo trabajar en todas esas Ã¡reas, pero en privado no. Bueno, asÃ­ como en colonias privadas tambiÃ©n tambiÃ©n yo tengo acceso para eso, pero mi licencia no dice residencial, o sea, mi anuncio no dice residencial comercial, solo dice landscaping, nomÃ¡s asÃ­, y estÃ¡ el Ã¡rea tengo 80 80, este, este millas alrededor de Seattle, Â¿sÃ­? Mhm. SÃ­. Eso es lo que tengo, 80 millas lo que cubro, pero eh la website no no no funciona. Â¿Por quÃ© no funciona? Es mi pregunta. No, no estÃ¡ optimizada, seÃ±or, estÃ¡ orgÃ¡nica, pues. Mire, ahÃ­ le va. Le voy a mandar una pÃ¡gina donde usted va a ver el nÃºmero de su licencia, de todo, Â¿okay? Ya se lo mando, Â¿okay? PermÃ­tame. PermÃ­tame. Â¿Y usted vive en Arizona? No, nosotros estamos aquÃ­ en 8201, eh, por acÃ¡ aquÃ­ en Las Vegas, Nevada, seÃ±or. No, no estamos en Arizona. Â¿En dÃ³nde vive usted? En Las Vegas, seÃ±or. Ya se lo mando. Oh. Mire, en la pÃ¡gina que le mandÃ©, de Vicapia, creo que sÃ­ es usted porque sale de el de en agosto 20 eh 2023. El 22 de agosto usted la registrÃ³, creo, Â¿verdad? Â¿Correcto? En en dÃ³nde lo mandÃ³, en WhatsApp? AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© por mensaje de texto normal. AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© mi ID. A WhatsApp no tenemos, seÃ±or, por el sistema no no nos dejan usarlo. Por un mensaje de texto y correo electrÃ³nico. AhÃ­ se lo mandÃ© mi ID. A ver, dÃ©jame ver. Mensaje de texto. AhÃ­, jefe. El que le acabo de mandar, un link dice Dice, ""AquÃ­ puede ver nÃºmeros de licencia"", dice. SÃ­, jefe. AhÃ­ en esa pÃ¡gina usted va a ver su informaciÃ³n de su registro que tiene. De hecho, ahÃ­ sale su direcciÃ³n y todo, Â¿verdad? Eh eh el nÃºmero de folio que usted tiene es 605-315727. Pero si ya es usted, Â¿verdad? Eh, aquÃ­ puede ver que estÃ¡ registrado en el estado de Washington. Â¿Correcto? SÃ­. Y tiene su limited liability company. Â¿Verdad? Entonces, aquÃ­ en esa pÃ¡gina puede checar todo usted, de su informaciÃ³n. No sÃ© si usted sabÃ­a eso cuando lo registraron. Es que normalmente sÃ­ le dicen, pero hay veces que no le dicen, Â¿verdad? Pero vÃ©alo, chÃ©quelo. AhÃ­ estÃ¡ muy bueno, Â¿verdad? Y tambiÃ©n, este, Â¿quÃ© mÃ¡s? La, mira, hay tarjetas de negocio digitales tambiÃ©n. Yo le mandÃ© una que tengo con una compaÃ±Ã­a de landscaping que le hicimos a Ã©l, pero digital, con cÃ³digo QR y todo. Nosotros ahÃ­ le pegamos su pÃ¡gina web, cÃ³digo QR, redes sociales y todo. AhÃ­ le mandÃ© la muestra. Pero es una compaÃ±Ã­a real de landscaping, nomÃ¡s que estÃ¡ en en Borlensen, Iowa, Â¿okay? Entonces, le digo, o sea, son puras compaÃ±Ã­as que tiene experiencia para la promociÃ³n en Estados Unidos, CanadÃ¡, MÃ©xico, Australia y Bulgaria, donde usted le cubrimos, Â¿okay? Ah, esta compaÃ±Ã­a que le estoy hablando se llama 411 locals, tiene desde 2007 haciendo promociÃ³n digital y ha trabajado con 30,000 compaÃ±Ã­as. Yo yo apenas tengo aquÃ­ en en esta compaÃ±Ã­a trabajando eh 3 aÃ±os casi ya, Â¿okay? Entonces, a lo que a a lo que iba a estar esto es lo que yo hago aquÃ­. Mi trabajo es ofrecer la promociÃ³n. Si lo hace, pues le registraremos su cuenta, si no, pues no pasa nada, Â¿verdad? Es lo que yo hago, Â¿okay? SÃ­ se puede, sÃ­ se puede, se puede redactar otra website con la misma presentaciÃ³n o no? Ah, como, mire, sÃ­, jefe, con el mismo, con el mismo diseÃ±o, porque dice que no se puede arreglar esa o sÃ­ se puede arreglar esa? AhÃ­ le va. Si usted se registra con nosotros, es es mejor que usemos la de nosotros porque una, ya viene incluido en el paquete, dos, para que la informaciÃ³n que en Google estÃ© directo y y para que estÃ© conectado todo seguramente ahora sÃ­ bien, pues es mejor hacerlo de esa forma para cumplir todos los reglamentos que tiene Google, Â¿okay? Â¿Para que se ponga? No me dijo cuÃ¡l era el precio del No me dijo cuÃ¡l era el precio de los 6 meses. AhÃ­ le va. Ah, okay. Eh, dÃ©jame ver, 6 meses. 6 por Â¿QuÃ© es este? SerÃ­a como general contractor, Â¿verdad? PermÃ­tame, deja checo. Landscaping. Landscaping con todo, este, le querÃ­a poner remodela, ajÃ¡. Â¿RemodelaciÃ³n, verdad? Ah, no, no podrÃ­a remodelaciÃ³n. Solo pintura, pintura y piso de madera, este, eso pondrÃ­a. Landscaping. Pero eso ya, eso lo podrÃ­amos hablar antes. Casi lo tengo en mi tarjeta. Yo solo le mando mi tarjeta ya. SÃ­, ahÃ­ le va. Mira, si usted trabaja con nosotros 6 meses son 1,829.94, Â¿verdad? 1,800.00. SÃ­, sÃ­, 6 meses pegados, pero nosotros no hacemos que firme nada, aquÃ­ es de mes a mes. El servicio con nosotros es pospago automÃ¡tico recurrente. Â¿QuÃ© es pospago? Eh digamos que usted empezaba conmigo el dÃ­a de hoy, Â¿verdad? Que empiece con los 49.99 y se quedaba conmigo hasta el dÃ­a 16 de enero. SerÃ­an 304.99 dividido, pues, por mes, Â¿verdad? Ahora, de ese, de ese 16 de enero al 18, hasta el 18 de enero, supongamos que usted se vaya y ya no trabaje con nosotros, se cobran por los dos dÃ­as trabajados. Eso significa pospago.

Speaker B (00:30 - 00:49): I did ask my assistant to call you because we're seeing several people in your local area right now who currently looks for your type of service. And that's the reason why we did call you right now. Because we're looking for a reputable business so we can actually partner up with to actually feature in front of those people.

Speaker C (02:19 - 02:20): Yes, I am.
Speaker B (02:20 - 02:48): Right, well, here's the thing, James. The reason why I did call you right now is because our company is the one who closely monitors the online traffic search of people looking and searching for your services right now. Specifically in your city. Right. And in Fact in the past, for today's change, there is already a total of 713 total monthly search coming from the population looking and searching for your services right now.
Speaker A (02:48 - 02:50): So if I could put your business.
Speaker B (02:50 - 03:14): In front of those interested people searching and looking for your services, that would be something very, very beneficial. Right, Jane? Right. Now, here's what we do, Jane. When people search online for junk removal services in Lakewood City in Washington, they usually don't type in a business name. Right? They just search for the service of what they're looking for.
Speaker C (03:14 - 03:15): Correct.
Speaker B (03:15 - 03:42): Like junk removal means or the best junk removal service in liquid. And if you're not showing up, your competitors are getting those phones. Right? And that is the reason why we're here. Because we want to make sure that at any time of day, if someone is looking and searching for your services, they would be able to find you front and center your competition. Have you ever heard about J Dog Junk removal and Hauling? Do you know them?
Speaker C (03:42 - 03:43): Who are they again?
Speaker B (03:43 - 03:46): J Dog Junk Removal and Hauling. Do you know them?
Speaker B (03:49 - 03:53): Junk removal and hauling. Yes. Do you know these people? You mentioned you're in Lakewood, right?
Speaker C (03:53 - 03:56): Yes, I'm trying to see. Yeah, I can see them.
Speaker B (03:57 - 03:59): Do you know them personally or no?
Speaker C (03:59 - 03:59): No.
Speaker B (04:00 - 04:05): How about Joe's Junk Removal and Demolition Elves? Does it ring a bell?
Speaker C (04:06 - 04:08): No, not really. I haven't looked at my competition.
Speaker B (04:10 - 04:40): Well, yeah, right. Well, I don't want you to mind them. Okay, but why this matters, it's because these are actually the ones who are now getting this big check out of those already interested customers. Well, it's not because they're better than you, but because they are likely the most visible in the eyes of Scott and your company or your business is not even there. You know, that's the tough part right now. Because even though you're the best option for junk removal in the area, but this.
Speaker C (04:41 - 04:43): I'm sorry, how do you know that?
Speaker B (04:43 - 04:45): Sorry, how do you. What do you.
Speaker C (04:45 - 04:47): You said I'm the best junk remover. I'm like, how do you know that?
Speaker A (04:47 - 04:49): Yeah, well, basically I know for sure.
Speaker B (04:49 - 05:19): You provide quality works. Right. So this customer should be also calling you as well. Correct. So that's the top part right now. Even though you are the best option for every customer, but if they can find you easily, they will just jump off and call other competition in your area. Right? And that is the reason why we're here. Because what we will do here at 411Locals is we want to make sure that your business shows up in front of those customers. So the calls and the jobs come to you instead of someone else.
Speaker C (05:19 - 05:20): How'd you find your number?
Speaker B (05:20 - 05:21): I'm sorry?
Speaker C (05:21 - 05:22): How do you find my number?
Speaker B (05:22 - 05:37): Well, basically speaking, we work with another umbrella of our company who find us those reliable people that can provide quality services that will be perfect fit with our program. And that's one of the reason why we're giving you a call right now. Okay.
Speaker B (05:41 - 05:42): Sorry.
Speaker C (05:43 - 05:48): No, I've missed the lead. Literally picking up your phone. I thought you guys were literally, like, a lead.

Okay.
Yeah, listen, how do you normally generate new clients, Cassidy?
Like when it comes to people that doesn't know you yet.

Um, basically I grew add advertisements, um, promote it on my different social media accounts.
Okay.
Um, create videos.
I mean, there's so many different things I do.
I see, I see.
Okay.
Um, because basically the jobs we want you to do, Cassidy, are not for us, basically for the people that search locally when they need them, right?
Um, and and now we have like a spot open on Google.
That's why we're calling you, right?
So, are you guys able to take on some of these jobs, Cassidy?
Of course.
Yeah, of course we are.
Yeah.
Okay, so, um, because I was trying to look for for like have you checked your company on Google lately?
Because we found you I think you're like on online directories, Facebook, right?
I'm on Facebook, yes.
Yeah, of course.
And I I was not able to find like a Google listing for your company, right?
Uh, not as of not as yet, no.
Okay, perfect.
Uh, the reason we're calling you is because well, I mean, within the last 30 days, we have almost like 2,000 searches for painting services.
So my my question is very simple, Cassidy, right?
If we can put you in front of these customers that are looking for your services, do you think that should be beneficial for your business?
Yeah, I definitely think it would be beneficial.
Okay.
Are you the the one that takes the decisions for this company?
Are you the the sole owner?
Um, I'm the administrative office kind of lady.
Um, yeah, my husband does all the I see, I see.

Okay, so you have a crew as well that can help you in case that like we have like a big project, you guys can take it on.
You guys can like get more people to help you, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
How far can you travel, Cassidy?
Let's say when it comes to maybe uh, 20, 30, 50 miles radius.
I'd say anywhere from like um, well, I live in we live in Dexter.
So if I were to like put a name on it, the farthest I think we'd travel depending on the price of the job would probably be Augusta and north would probably be around Bangor or no area.
Okay.
And and like I said, depending on the job.
I mean, if there's a Portland job that's like a $3,000 job that's going to be a week, you know, worth the work or whatever, then yeah, we would go down.
But it really depends on what the job is and how long the duration of the job is.
I see.
So what's your local zip code there in Dexter?
Like you said, 88230?
No, it's 04930.
04930.
Let me show what we've got there.
Okay.
All right.
Perfect.
So you don't have no website as of now, yet.
No website, just like social media.
Right.
Yes, so I'm I'm working on building that.
Because you said you advertise.
Um, I'm just trying we we don't have money to or extra money, I should say, to put towards um, any extra advertising.
Um, I did try to put in for a Google um, business.
Right.
However, um, I'm still waiting on that.
So, yeah, you you you're probably on the verification.
Verification status because you need to verify your company on Google.
Um, so they can let you list it.
Okay.
So basically that's what we certify here.
We're Google certified partners, Cassidy, right?
So we'll take care of all that for you, right?

You know, it's going to be something that you guys are able to do, right?
Um, so you'll be in charge on that and we'll be dealing with the rest.
Is this something that you might want to, you know, have an open mind to listen to it and see what we can do about it if the price is right?
Huh?
Um, well, like I said, I don't really have any extra funds right now though.
I mean, I I'm interested but like we if we had the extra money, I would definitely do it, but we don't have the extra money right this second.
I mean, I'm not asking you for money right now.
Don't worry, we are post-paid service, meaning that we work first and we charge later, right?
Uh, when it comes to to to uh, to our services.
Uh, and we we're very flexible, right?
I mean, I don't think how much you got in mind?
Do you think we're going to charge like $1,000?
I mean, no, I'm just thinking just general money wise.
No, no, no, no.
Basically, so no, we're very flexible.
I'll go ahead and explain the project.
Nothing to compromise, Cassidy.
If you like what you hear, we can move forward.
If not, I mean, we can part ways friends.
Don't worry.
Sounds good?
Okay.
All right.
So listen, the Google listing thing, okay?
Um, yeah, I mean, that's how everybody kind of look for like when they're when they're looking for clothes, any type of service, food, like 80% 80% of people use Google when they're kind of ready to buy, right?
And 90% never scroll scroll past page one.
Uh, I want to compete with those companies that I sent to you.
Do you know any of them?
No.
No?
Did you get them?
The link The link that I sent to you?
No, no, I got them.
I I just don't know them.
Okay.
All right.
So basically, um, I mean, we will be competing with them, right?

Speaker A (00:18 - 00:27): Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Mister Oscar. Yeah. So this is Oscar as well and we're looking for available company to work with and we should increase our customers looking for.
Speaker B (00:42 - 00:53): OK. I've only been with my business for a year, but I've always complied with what the State, license, insurance, everything, everything that corresponds, requires.
Speaker A (00:54 - 01:11): Excellent, excellent, very good. That's very good for being a year in. We have had business owners who have had three, four years and still without a license. It's good that you are doing things right from the beginning, Mr. Oscar. Very good. And I want to think that you already had experience before, right?
Speaker B (01:11 - 01:32): Yes, well, before starting my business, I spent seven years working for some people, so I also had to learn a little more English, so I can also have conversations with builders and homeowners, contractors and all that. So I took on the task of starting my business and here we are.
Speaker A (01:32 - 02:01): Well, it didn't take that long either, seven years in which he learned the trade, in which he learned more new services, in which he also learned to speak English and that he decided, it's good that you made this decision, Mr. Oscar, to make your own money and be your own boss and win. Excellent, because the truth is that remodeling leaves quite well. Very good. And Mr. Oscar, with these seven years of experience that you have, can you do both residential and commercial services or do you focus more on residential?
Speaker B (02:01 - 02:13): Well, I do both, honestly I do both and so far I haven't had any problems, thank God and we've been doing, well, we haven't been doing great, but regularly stable. We are, thank God.
Speaker A (02:13 - 02:31): No, it is understood, the truth is that all businesses when they start, especially the first years, are complicated because people don't know them, they have to be making their name, they have to be making themselves known with the services that you offer. So they go.
Speaker B (02:32 - 03:28): You know, before that, thank God, before starting my business, many clients, I'm not going to say that I took them from those I worked with, no, none of that, but all the clients and all the builders saw that I was always the face, I was the one with the face, my boss rarely arrived or only sent the invoices and all that and the claims, the guarantees, all that was me, it was me. So the clients, both builders, both referral, called me directly, even though I passed them on to the boss, the boss would say no, no, no, just tell me the price you're going to give and then the boss would charge. So thank God, I got a lot of customers when I started my business, so I had the task of going to places and houses and calling, God, this is my business, my insurance and all that and they started calling me quickly, so I talked to my ex-boss and said, don't you think I'm taking them from you? He says no, no, no, all your struggle gave mine, don't worry and I hope you do well.
Speaker A (03:28 - 03:42): Of course, and above all, he learned something that he has to show his face too, maybe and his business is growing, but you are going to show your face and so that they know you have natural hinting and remodeling and who is behind the whole product.
Speaker B (03:42 - 03:42): Exactly.
Speaker A (03:44 - 04:10): You always learn and the truth is that people who adapt to changes, people or business owners who know how to improve those services, not only of organizing but of showing their face, well it also is. Now Mr. Oscar, of the services that you do, because remodeling is broad, what are the services that you should do? Better remunerate your business.
Speaker B (04:10 - 04:44): OK, well look, what I do is the drywall, its roll taping, texture, all that, then comes the cleaning and then comes the painting, after that cleaning also general cleaning, I have other people who do general cleaning, like the people who clean the houses, after you've handed over the house you'll see that there's polo, stains, drops, all that, windows, doors, I have personnel for that and I also do tile, I do flooring, I do different activities, you understand me, Insulation, all that.
Speaker A (04:45 - 05:01): Perfect, very good, well if it is a fairly complete service, until the cleaning there is no dust, the post construction clean. OK, excellent, well it's a pretty complete business. They do the internal remodeling and what about the external, for example window.
Speaker B (05:03 - 05:39): Everything that is roofing I don't throw it away, I don't do it honestly what is the siting, I do any wall, a part of the house, I'm not going to tell you that I remodel it all. Why? Well, because I tried to do it and when I tried to do it my insurance tells me if it covers you, but your insurance will go up more like handyman. So your insurance already changes is higher, although the numbers are looking good right now, but it is higher and at the same time when you have nothing and you see that it goes down sometimes you will struggle a little because a high insurance has its risks.
Speaker A (05:39 - 05:46): OK, well, then of the exterior that if it comes to be is window door installation, it would be like the silent repair.
Speaker B (05:47 - 05:47): That's right.
Speaker A (05:48 - 05:50): Not the complete installation, but only some.
Speaker B (05:50 - 05:53): Repairs. Repairs, very good.
Speaker A (05:53 - 06:13): So we are going to focus more on what I am seeing, on the interior remodeling, which is what should be more, which is better for you to do. OK, perfect. And currently Mr. Oscar, do you have any method or what method do you use? Rather that question, what method do you use to get new customers? By recommendations.
Speaker B (06:14 - 07:39): Exactly. I even have a page on Yout that honestly, I'm not going to tell you honest, I'm going to be honest with you, don't think it helps me, it doesn't serve me because thank God I tell you, we are accredited and with the years when I worked for someone they called me, so already like the weekends that I didn't work with the boss they would tell me excuse me Oscar, I know it's the weekend, but you know that I got a. Yes you know that the whole floor of the laundry room was raised because the washing machine hose broke. Oscar, can you change this sheetrock And once that I can't give you an insurance because I don't have a business, it doesn't matter. To date, the work you have done here with us, very stable and well done. So call a company, a business, yes, the insurance and everything, but they come with. They do what they want, they do it sometimes reluctantly, if there are people or not, well when the house is alone, so you always this and you are always available. Well yes it sounds bad, but we all use money. Well yeah, it sounds. So to date thank God I tell you, I have not lacked work sometimes even, even I do not answer the calls because I already know the three hours to fifth already up the mountain and they pay me very well, they pay me the lodging and everything but sometimes also my family comes first You understand me?
Speaker A (07:39 - 08:24): No, of course, of course. The family is always first and in fact you have this business for them, you want to give them more time, you want to give them more attention and that they have what is necessary more than necessary. Exactly, the family will always be first. I am always of the same idea that family is always first. Well look Mr. Oscar, we have excellent news. First of all I like it because I'm talking to you, you have a lot of experience, you have the desire, it didn't take you long to say you know what? Well I'm going to put the batteries, I know how to do it, I know how to make the contracts, I have my license in the first year and just last week here in the area where you are and please correct me if I'm wrong, here in Cowell in zip code 83605 Is that correct?
Speaker B (08:24 - 08:25): Yes, yes.
Speaker A (08:25 - 12:36): OK. Just last week we had a total of 1345 searches from people requesting construction and remodeling services. The truth is that there is a lot of work in the area where you are and what you were talking about there is no need to be traveling two hours, more than an hour. These searches that I am telling you Mr. Oscar are happening there in your local area, in your zip code so that you travel twenty, thirty minutes and people are looking for the services. So unlike what you already have because I see Natural Painting and Remodeling effectively in Drills there you have your information and also in MapQuest is practically the same. We unlike these companies, we are not an online directory, what we do is work with Google, we are Google Partners. This means that when people are looking for the services of any service you do, Drywall Painting, Remodeling Services, Bus construction, Cleaning or any other service, people will be able to know your business, Google will recommend your business and you will appear in front of those interested customers near your local area so you can get a better idea. Mr. Oscar, if we search right now Remodeling Services there in your local area you can search Remodeling Services to see what your competition is. Ethical remodeling LLC appears with 5 stars, 54 reviews Terry Construction appears equally with 5 stars, this one has a little more review 75 and there is Treasure Valley Remodeling and Restoration with 4.2 stars and this one has 9 ratings, reviews, sorry. These companies are the ones that appear on the first page of Google and there are more and what we want is that you can also appear on the first page when people look for the services that you can do so we are going to use the keywords the Google algorithm when they are looking for the services will present your business so that is what we want to do Mr. Oscar, that you are in the best place where to be if you have a business that is in Google. Now, what is the first thing we are going to do? The first thing we are going to do to attract the attention of those customers in your local area is going to be a professional website I would like you to see first of course Mr. Oscar how professional we are and how the design of the website can be for your business Look, I sent you a text message with a link that says Locals starts if you click on that link appears the design of the website and this is something that I just did right now in a couple of minutes more or less with information that you gave me of the services that you do we can change the design, put your own photos or videos in fact it would be important so that people can see in detail the quality of your work, that can be convinced and we put the name of your business What do you think of the design of the page sir? If you want you can put me Speaker so we continue talking while you see it OK, so we will put for example there the services, we put service 1, drywall services, service 2, painting services, remodeling kitchens, bathrooms, h. We will focus primarily on those that better remunerate without leaving aside Insulation, Window installation, Siding Repair but we will focus on the projects that better remunerate Mr. Oscar OK, perfect. Now, unlike Yelp or any other lead generator we do not sell leads, we do not charge any commission either very well, you can receive 20, 30 or more calls a month and you do not have to be paying for each of those customers who call you, in fact customers will call you directly, we are not intermediaries. Your phone number appears when people are interested in the services in any of the advertising services that we are going to do with that they click on your phone number will be linked the call directly to you or to you Mr. Oscar, there with you negotiate types of work, the costs, when they can start the project, everything necessary to the project that your customers need OK? Any questions up to this point Mr. Oscar?
Speaker C (12:36 - 12:38): No ma'am, can you hear me well?
Speaker A (12:38 - 14:27): Perfect, very good. Now Mr. Oscar, how effective are we going to be unlike Yelp? Well we are going to put it in a very simple way. We use Google more, we use Google every day and we don't use it so much and to search Right? So when people are searching on Google, Google is going to recommend it, it puts your business on the first page of Google and this is a complete service, this is not only a website, the website is one of the tools that we use. We put your own domain as W naturaltinkingandremodeling. Com At the level of large companies we put a business in the 50 directories equally most important in your local area Super Pages, Yellow Pages, Yahoo Business, mapquest, thumbtech and more. What we want is to make sure that you have a constant flow of potential customers who need services and who are willing to pay well for their work, OK? And that you don't have to be going to 2 hours 20, 30 minutes, there is a lot of work there where you are. We create your official listing in Google My Business and Google Maps so Google will already recommend you and we will cover all these guidelines that Google asks and so we make sure that every day people who are looking for your services will be easy to find them. Very well, so that is how we work. Now we are going to be realistic also we want to know what is the capacity that you can take of these 1,345 searches that I am telling you and we have to be realistic, maybe not all go with you. Let's assume, because there are many companies on the first page, assuming that at least 10% is a fairly real number, we are talking about 12 to 13. If you receive 12 to 13 calls Mr. Oscar a week, how many of them could you do the work for?
Speaker C (14:27 - 14:28): Well look, being honest.
Speaker B (14:31 - 14:31): More than anything.
Speaker C (14:31 - 15:29): I have an accountant and I work. I don't think I just spend my time like some people who have their business; they already have a business and just stay at home. I'm working; I spray, I prepare, I do everything, and sometimes I don't have time to check my SketchUp. So, she's the one who calls me, ""Today is the 12th, by Monday the 16th, there has to be a house and it's from this date to that date, OK, everything is ready, you have to get it done."" I never wait. The company whose materials I like, I go get them because waiting is a waste of time. I do my SketchUp with the people and everything and I get moving, so she's reminding me all the time. So, I would have to see, because if I answer people right now, no, I can handle 5 clients, and then they call you, ""Hey, you messed up, what happened?""
Speaker A (15:32 - 16:59): And that also matters a lot for the valuation they're going to give your business, that you commit, that you're responsible. Now, look, Mr. Oscar, let's think about it this way. As you're telling me, assuming it's one, at least one, because you've been doing well, because you have your schedule well organized, assuming you could only do one, I think, and that would be approximately like 4 a month on average. I think if you at least do these four projects in any case, we would be helping to grow your business. Very good. And Mr. Oscar, the cost for this complete online service, which is your website, your own domain W Natural Thinking and Remodeling, your business in the 50 most important directories, your business in an official listing on Google My Business and Google Maps, so that Google will recommend your business, this has a monthly cost of only $363.99 a month. I think if we achieve that goal at a minimum, I mean, in a worst-case scenario it could be more, obviously, and what we want is for your business to grow, but I think if we manage to make these clients interested in your services and have a constant flow of potential clients, it would be easy for you to pay these 363 dollars and 99 cents, right?
Speaker B (17:01 - 17:03): It has a monthly cost, it would be a cost.
Speaker A (17:03 - 17:28): Consecutive monthly 363 dollars and 99 cents. That's right, month to month, and effectively Mr. Oscar, it's a month to month services, which means that if you see that we are effectively making your business grow, that people are calling you and, most importantly, that you are making money thanks to that exposure, the only thing you will want is to continue with the service, right?
Speaker B (17:28 - 17:41): Yes, of course. I understand what you're telling me, everything you're telling me, of course I understand it. But here's the thing. I say it with all due respect so that no one is offended, because apart from you, different ones have spoken to me.
Speaker A (17:42 - 17:44): This era everyone gets offended.
Speaker B (17:45 - 17:59): Exactly, exactly. Exactly. So not an offer. No, no, no, I don't know what to call it. Well, yes, okay, the offer is not expensive, honestly it's not expensive because you spend more on nonsense, honestly.
Speaker C (18:00 - 18:01): But there it goes.
Speaker B (18:01 - 18:28): Giving me a commitment for. Because I know my business very well, thank you. I am sane, regular. To commit myself and not fulfill it, I don't like. I don't like it. Why? Because until now, thank God, I say again, we are busy. Since I started my business, we are busy. I tell you again, there are times when I don't answer the calls and it looks a little bad, rude, but in my land we are like that, he who grabs too much, holds little.
Speaker A (18:28 - 18:29): Yes, that's correct.
Speaker B (18:29 - 18:36): You understand? So, why am I going to make a commitment if I'm not going to fulfill it later? OK, because later on.
Speaker A (18:38 - 19:25): This is where many people get a little confused, Mr. Oscar, because that service is not designed to overload your business with clients. The service that we are offering is for you to choose the clients that best remunerate you. It's so you don't have to be traveling far, Mr. Oscar. Now, in any case, what it means to have a professional website and put your business online, that already gives your business an additional value, that people can already know your projects, that people already begin to recognize your name. Because effectively, Mr. Oscar, there is a big difference between companies looking for clients or clients looking for the company.
Speaker B (19:25 - 21:05): That's right, you're very right. I'm going to understand you very well there. And I go back to the same thing, I'm very interested because as I say, I've been spoken to apart from different apps or something like that, I don't know what to call them. And if I quickly talk to my accountant, ""You know what? Look, these people spoke to me and like this, like that,"" she communicates with the people, just like with you, she asks for more information, everything that goes, what it is based on. Then she tells me ""Oscar, they are not asking for much, but as you just said, they are giving you, they are opening a door for you to grow more. Are you capable of growing more? Well, if you already have more sprayers, well to date no, you're the one who sprays, are you going to hire more personnel, more expenses, more payroll, more insurance, are you capable of all that?"" And right now no, because I only have one year. So once you believe, when you say, ""I currently have three people and I four and the two girls that clean the houses that I have."" When you already have a bigger business, immediately you and give me the order and I communicate with those who call us and we see which one suits us best. And absolutely, enough to grow and not only here in the State of areas, you can move to Utah, you can move further up, even all the contractors with whom you have worked come from Montana, come from Utah, come from other states, from Wisconsin, come from Washington and they say, they enter calls or messages or emails, they say ""Hey natural pa, we have a project here in some buildings in Utah that is young, is paying hotel, is paying all that."" Are you prepared for that? Honestly, so, so much so no. So at least the vision does not remain.
Speaker A (21:05 - 22:47): That OK, businesses, there is no business that is a success, that has success as we want to see your business, no Amazon, or Facebook, or Tesla, or anyone in a year, I don't know how to say all that. So, look Mr. Oscar, the truth is that this is a process, it's not something that's going to happen overnight, don't think that if you do it, you're going to start being on Google tomorrow. We have to go through a validation process. Google needs to verify your business, that you effectively have your license, your registrations, that you effectively do the remodeling services, we have to put all those records in the directories. So this is also a process Mr. Oscar, it's not something that happens overnight, no? Yes, of course, we are also going to grow at your pace Mr. Oscar. Very good, because this is like any other social network, not because someone has a, a page on Facebook or on Instagram, it means that they are going to go viral immediately, that they are going to have thousands of likes, it doesn't work like that. So, Mr. Oscar, what we want is to start this process that within a year we are going to increase all these visibilities, OK? In fact, look, I'm going to send you the projection that we have for your business right now. So, in the first month we are going to build all the advertising material. At the beginning we are going to gain momentum and we are going to gain confidence with Google. There in the link that I just sent you, did you receive it, it's a bar, well, it's a graph.
Speaker B (22:48 - 22:49): What is your name, sorry?
Speaker A (22:49 - 22:51): Oscar, like you.
Speaker B (22:51 - 22:57): Oscar, give me a second, brother, I'm going. I have to talk to the Sacramento gafas.
Speaker A (22:57 - 22:58): OK, I'll wait here. OK.

Speaker A (00:26 - 00:29): Started junior flooring for about 25.
Speaker B (00:29 - 00:31): 25 years. Wow.
Speaker A (00:31 - 00:32): Yeah.
Speaker B (00:32 - 00:46): And I mentioned to you, sir, Julia, I have here my manager who asked me to give you a call. Hello, Art, I am here, Junior, the owner, Junior flooring. He has licensed and insured. He does in the business for 25 years.
Speaker C (00:47 - 00:50): Perfect. Thank you. Hello, Junior, can you hear me okay?
Speaker A (00:51 - 00:51): Yeah, I'm here.
Speaker C (00:51 - 01:14): All right, perfect. Look, we don't take too much of your time or mine. My name is Art and I'm the area manager for 411 locals. What we do here, Junior, is actually help business like yours. Yeah. To get more visibility, more clients, more traffic. Basically better revenue for your company. Right. Is that something that you'd be interested in?
Speaker A (01:14 - 01:32): Well, at the moment, no. I actually already have a web designer I'm working with and we kind of already pretty known locally. I mean, I just opened another crew, but I mean I'm here all the time on all the job sites. So I was just getting more business for another few I have.
Speaker C (01:33 - 02:07): Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. Well, this is not only the website design, you know what I mean, Junior? That's everything that entitles your marketing, right? From algorithm, keywords, everything like that. So let's say somebody is looking for hardwood flooring without even knowing the name of your company. Junior Flooring, the name of your company will pop up on the search. So it's going to be, you know, it's going to be better for you as far as more money basically for your company. Is that something that you might be interested in?
Speaker A (02:07 - 02:37): Well, like I said, I already have a web designer and I know you're kind of saying what else you guys have to offer, but we're already one of the top rated companies here, known locally all throughout. And it's not just through Google reviews. I mean, I'm already on Google, there's other websites and stuff. But like I said, the whole point of me working with my web designer is to build our brand out a little more. And we're going to start selling some materials as well. So we're kind of opening to be a lot more of a corporation, a bigger business.
Speaker C (02:38 - 03:04): Nice. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. No, it sounds like you're pretty much on the right path, right? I mean, imagine 25 years of experience. That's amazing. That's really good. Look, Junior, obviously it sounds like you're already doing great here with your web designer. Let me send you some information about our company. Maybe at some point, if you think this would be a good fit, go ahead and give us a call. Okay. And maybe we can help you out and see what the options are for you.
Speaker A (03:04 - 03:15): Sounds good. I'm always looking for openings. Sounds good. Then if you guys go ahead and send me a message, I can go take a look at it. I'll be here off of work around 10, probably 6, so.
Speaker C (03:15 - 03:16): Probably 6.
Speaker A (03:17 - 03:24): You guys have availability? You guys could feel free to call me and then I could take a look at. You guys have a website and more.
Speaker C (03:26 - 03:43): Yeah, I actually send you my number. Well, the number of the company, my name, my extension, all the services that we will be providing you and our website, our official website. And also a short video.
Speaker A (03:43 - 03:46): Sounds good. I'll be happy to check it out and I'll let you know.
Speaker C (03:46 - 03:53): Okay, perfect. You can just send. You can shoot me a text directly and we can schedule a call back if you want.
Speaker A (03:53 - 03:55): Awesome. Sounds good then. Thank you.
Speaker C (03:55 - 03:56): Thank you so much. Bye. Bye.

Speaker B (00:54 - 00:58): Well, it surely tells you you definitely know what you're doing then. Yes, sir.
Speaker C (00:58 - 01:06): I also have many trades under my belt. It took me a little while to decide to be the contractor, but doing all those trades is what helped me decide to do that.
Speaker B (01:06 - 01:13): I'm glad that you actually decided to be your own boss, do your own thing and make your own money now instead of just working hard for somebody else, right?
Speaker C (01:13 - 01:14): Yes, sir.
Speaker B (01:14 - 01:17): So are you the sole owner or like, how many owners are there?
Speaker C (01:17 - 01:32): So I'm the sole owner, but 20% of my company is through a buddy because I go through an RMO agency. So he owns 20% of the stock in the company because I'm a corporation, but he doesn't run the show or anything. I do everything.
Speaker B (01:32 - 01:37): You do everything. Okay. Do you have workers or employees to help you with the job though?
Speaker C (01:37 - 01:38): Yes, I do.
Speaker B (01:38 - 01:42): Okay, very good. Now tell me about your. Can you tell me about the type of jobs you usually take on, Chris?
Speaker C (01:43 - 01:51): So I do a lot of jobs. I mean, mostly carpentry, flooring, sheetrock jobs, tile jobs.
Speaker B (01:51 - 01:55): All right, so but if you could pick and choose though, which type of job do you like the most?
Speaker C (01:55 - 01:57): Honestly, carpentry is my main skill.
Speaker B (01:57 - 01:58): Carpentry. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker C (01:58 - 01:59): Flooring is my second.
Speaker B (02:00 - 02:11): All right. And I'd like to ask you this because we both know, Chris, there's actually a lot out there who does what you do. You know, being in the business for four years, how are you usually Finding work, you know, to keep yourself and the rest of the team busy.
Speaker C (02:11 - 02:24): So in all honesty, I subcontracted through a company called Tough Shed. I don't know if you've heard of them. They subcontract out sheds to me and I build sheds. I'm actually in the middle of building an 8 by 10 barn right now.
Speaker B (02:24 - 02:30): Okay, well, they actually send out work to you because they trust you and they know you do a good job. Simple as that, right?
Speaker C (02:30 - 02:33): Yeah, I've been working for them for about six years now.
Speaker B (02:33 - 03:24): Okay, well, let me tell you the reason I called because I really like the fact that you've been doing it a long time now. Okay. And this should be a very good fit. My company, 411Locals, specialize in watching traffic of search terms and Internet. And we are seeing a significant amount of traffic going on from people searching even at this time of the year. If we talk about San Joaquin county area the past 30 days, I'm actually see near over 15,728 searches from people going online looking for a carpenter, which is. Right, 15,000. Now imagine this, Chris. Somebody out there goes online, they go to Google and they type in, you know, reliable carpenter near me. They type in flooring, insulation, sheetrocking, towel work. Even if they don't know you, they're going to see your business name, phone number popping up on first banks, Google in front of them. Do you think it'd be beneficial for your business?
Speaker C (03:24 - 03:34): Yes, it would. But at the time, right now, I'm kind of stacked for work right now my down season isn't until about January or February. I work about six days a week right now.
Speaker B (03:34 - 03:35): Are you saying you're employed?
Speaker C (03:36 - 03:39): Yeah, remember I told you that I subcontracted through subshed?
Speaker B (03:39 - 03:48): Okay, so you're actually employed. Okay. And so you do your construction work on the side, then like after work and during the weekend, is that right?
Speaker C (03:48 - 03:54): Well, like I was saying, I'm not an employee of Tough Shed. They subcontract out the jobs to me and my crew.
Speaker B (03:54 - 04:03): Okay. Okay. They're constantly giving you work like six days a week. Yes, okay, exactly. No problem. But appreciate your time with me, Chris. You have a good one.

We verify the search traffic, that is, what we search for. When people are looking for landshiping services there in California, in your local area, we make sure that...

Speaker D (02:17 - 02:31): Thirty dollars per month? One hundred sixty. I don't think that's a Google listing service. Do you know what services they are going to offer you or how they are going to promote themselves?
Speaker A (02:34 - 02:35): They are going to upload us on five platforms.
Speaker D (02:36 - 02:43): On five platforms? They are more like directories, right?
Speaker A (02:43 - 02:49): They're like Alexa, Google, Facebook, Instagram.
Speaker D (02:49 - 03:01): Like on social media, right? On social media. OK. That makes sense. I mean, for you to have an official listing on Google My Business and Google Maps 60 dollars wouldn't cover that.

So the shops, you know, if they don't have a mobile, if shops, they don't have a mobile mechanic, you know, they they they shut down in the middle, you know, 5:30, you know, 6:00, you know? So, you know, they're not open. Exactly. that plate, you know, they have to get both out of assistance to get towed there. So, you know. And the roadside assistance because we have so many like partners in different states, right? They do car uh uh uh roadside assistance and they kind of do the same thing as you, right? So they have the car the the roadside assistance industry. Well, actually, they also have a shop. So they can take the cars over there, fix them, right? You know, keep going. Or maybe they just need to translate their car to a different place. Nothing to get fixed, it just need to be moving like an expensive car, you know, like as an example, right? Uh so kind goes together. That's that's perfectly right. So that's what I want to do with your business, Kendra. The company names 411 locals, that's the that's the name of my company. If you like kind of search it on Google, you'll be able to find us. Actually, I can also send you the website as well. Uh we're Google certified partners, okay? So what I want to do here for you is kind of work with you, okay? The way you want to work with us, kind of we adjust to what's your goal, right? So we can make it happen for you. So how this works? Every time somebody's going to look for like any type of mechanic uh services that you specialize on, Kendra, my goal, my job is to get them to find you. Make sure they're going to be able to see Dr. Ham Mobile Mechanic Services. All right? They're going to be calling you, I mean there's no middleman right here. You're going to charge your prices, okay? We're not taking any percentage, none of that, okay? We know you're a small company, okay? So we want to kind of, you know, earn your trust first, right? So we can make it take this something successful, right? So what we're going to be doing is that putting you on the maps, putting you on Google Maps, so people know where are you, you know? Uh Yeah. Yeah. Let's put an example, roadside assistance, right? I'm kind of driving through like a closed highway, my car broke down. What I going to do? I'm going to go to Google and just type in roadside assistance services, right? Mhm. That's all it takes. That's all it takes. Then my job will be make sure they'll find you. They called you, go ahead and do the job, charge for it, done deal, right? That's the goal. Yeah. Um, I don't know, you got any calls about this before, okay? Um, or maybe they came up with a different strategy. But on our end, this is SEO. This is what we specialize on, okay? It's more organically, more cheaper than buying leads, the the paying AdWords, right? You name it because SEO, 84% of people use Google when they're ready to buy, right? Or they're ready to buy a service, knows food, anything. And what happens? 94% never, never scroll past page one. You know? Yeah. Those companies that that you see there, those are the ones getting the calls, right? So they don't struggle for anymore because I mean it took time for them to get there. Yeah. That's what I want to put you. I want to put you there, right? Um, Okay. What I'm offering you. But what what what what do I what do I have to do? What do I have to do and what's the contract to to to get in business with you? So basically, when it comes to like, no, I don't want you here because I I'm not going to force you, force you to stay with me because if you I want you to be with me because you love what we're going to be doing for for for your services, for your company, right? Not because I got you like uh lock into like a forced terms, right? It's a month-to-month services, right? So let's say what is your local zip code? Like where are you going to be covering? Okay. It's eight uh well, I I can I can be in Scottsdale. I could be in Gilbert. I could be in Chandler. Let's say cuz let's say let's think down the future because you say in eight months from now you'll be having a shop. That's right. Where is the the zip code? It's going to be it's going to be in Tempe. I'm I'm going to try to find a place in Tempe. I want I want to I want a place in Tempe because Tempe is going to be in the middle of everything. It's in the middle of Arizona.
So you know, I I it's not far from from uh Surprise. It's not far from Phoenix. It's not far from Chandler, Gilbert or Scottsdale. It's a little bit, but it's still right there in the middle of everybody and I get to, you know, yeah. So Okay. Okay, so I mean Tempe is on uh we have uh I mean 85218, 85280 zip codes. I mean it can be okay. Yeah. All right. Let me give you an idea. So how how you going to be doing this with us, okay? So what is what I'm offering you is the SEO, okay? The putting you on Google Maps, creating your your uh Google listing with Google, okay? We need to verify your company like straight with Google. Uh this is That belongs to you, okay? We're only doing the admin like following Google protocols, so we can get you all the way to the first page, right? But once again, this belongs to you. uh Kendra, okay? We're also going to create your your website. That's something that we'll be creating. Did you see the one that I sent you? It was just like a sample. Were you able to see it? Let me see. No? Uh here, I'm going to check it out right now. Uh I see it. It's just like a sample. It's just a sample, but if you have any pictures, if you don't have any right now, that's fine, okay? We'll find some, okay? But I would love. I would love to show like services that have been done by you, right? We we assign seven IT professionals to your account, so they can kind of focus on your campaign mainly, right? When it comes to the Okay. mechanic services. Um, we list your company on over 50 online directories just to get Google to trust you more, but don't get me wrong. Like people look for services on all those uh online directories. I'm talking about Yelp, Yellow Pages, Manta, local.com, super pages, uh Merchant Circle, Nextdoor. I mean, you name it. It's over 50, you know? But my main focus is Google, Google, Google, Google, right? If your customer after that he wants to go to to the website, that's an example, the one that I sent, they can just click on the website, okay, under your Google listing, they'll take us directly to your website. They want to go to your Facebook. Let's say you got a Facebook. I'll link it to the Google listing as well. My point is giving you the maximum exposure, right? That's my job. So you don't get charged for call, you don't get charged for job, you don't get charged for any type of percentage, because I'm not selling you that. I'm giving you the maximum exposure, right? Meaning there's no middleman, they're going to call you, you close the deal, you close, you charge your money, once again, done deal, right? But the how much you you will be charging like let's say an average job. The more basic job that you do, how much you charge in? No, diagnose, I charge 80 to 100 an hour. So it just it just depends. It depends on on on how big the job is and stuff. If I have to rebuild a transmission, Right. I have to charge them 8 to 100 an hour and stuff like that, you know? It's it's it's different because with my sets of skill, cuz I could do an alternator. It depends on the year and make a model. I could say, say 2010 Jeep. I could do that alternator in like 25 minutes or 20 minutes. So you know, I'm going to charge them, you know, 140 on on the spot just to replace it. Right. You know? So, yeah. Yeah. Let's let's put let's do what $50, $100 per job, let's say an average 200. Is that a good price as an example? Yeah, it is. Yeah, cuz I have to factor, I have to factor in my the convenience. I'm I'm being it's convenient and I have to factor in my my gas and and everything else that that I have to I have to, you know, that that make me complete the job and to get there and get it done successfully. So, you know, that's that's that's why mobile mechanic is is is expensive. They are they are expensive, you know? Is it the mobile mechanic just about driving? You I mean your car is going to broke down somewhere. It's not like they're taking the car to your shop. So that's like a already a service. Just going over there and fixing your car up, you know? Yeah. Exactly. If you don't have to move a finger. Exactly, exactly. And if you want me to move, and then I'll factor in too, if you want me to Uber you home or take you home, I can and I will get your car back home successfully. You know what I mean? So there's this is a lot of programs. Yeah, there's a lot of benefits on on that for for being convenient, you know? Just to get them so they don't have to don't have to wait in another car on a highway. They don't have to wait at Walmart, you know what I mean? A parking lot, you know? I I it's it's just it's convenient, you know? So there's a lot of services that I can give out give to them, you know? Exactly. Exactly. So that that's my goal. That's what I want to do for you, you know? Let's put let let's go back with you know, the the prices that you might be charged. An average, okay? 200, let's put it, you know? If we can give you, let's say from the visibility that we can give you, let's say 200 people is going to be able to see your company on the first page. Let's even go like more realistically, right? From those 200, only 10. 10 will be able to code you. How many of them you think you can close from those 10? In a day? Uh, that will be, let's say, no, let's be realistic. Let's say in the first, let's within a lapse of 30 days. Let's put it that way, okay? Realistic. All right. 200 people will be able to see your company and from those 200 people only 10. potential customer will calling you. How many of them you can close? Yeah. It's a month. In a month, I could close them within a week or a couple days. Okay, that means you're a really. That means you're a really, really hot closer. Yeah, because you got to understand. You got to understand how how how where my how my blueprint works, you know? Cuz I have I have um I have people that's that works that that's willing to work for me, you know what I mean? And and they they they're willing to work at different times and I know their timeframe and I I I know their schedule. So I just, oh, okay. Okay, right now. Okay, 10 p.m. 10:00 a.m. or or whatever time that's going to fit for you. So, you know, I I just book them in. I'll be like, hey, you know, this is this the address, this is the name, this is the phone number and this is the estimate that I give them and you go ahead and go do the job and let me know. I can after you uh you arrive, let me know the ETA. I'll let the customers know. I'll coordinate everything. So, you know, and if I if it all works. It all works. Perfect. Okay, love it. I mean, I see the closing the 10 of 10. Let's do the match. It would be like 2,000k, right? $2,000. That's that will be the ROI, the return of investment. That's what I want you to see this as an investment, not like an expense, right? Um, the price, okay? The price is very affordable, okay? To kind of just, we are a post-paid service. What that means, Kendra? It means that we work first and we charge later, okay? That's a post-paid service, right, Kendra? Um, the activation fee is just $99.99. That's all. You don't have to provide any information over the phone. You activate your account on your end, okay? Um, the monthly recurrent fee comes after 30 days. Let's say you sign up with me today, okay? Your next payment or the first payment for the monthly fee will be next year, the January the 16th, right? A little bit over 30 days, just to give you, you know, a few more days. Uh and you're only going to pay the uh just for the basics with this, which is Google listing, website and the over 50 online directories, $202.99, but not right now. A month. As and now it'll be a recurrent fee every month, every month, yes. Right? month. That's what it's almost 300 every month. 202. $202.99. 202? Yeah, 202. Okay. Yeah, it's just the basic Kendra because I can offer you more services. I mean, I can I can offer you even a booking engine, meaning that like I can book my only like let's say I want you to come and check my car. I book it myself on your website. That's a different tool. But that we'll add it on the monthly fee because that's like an extra $99.99. So I'm giving you the basic. We can start becoming visible in your area. Down the line, okay, when you are already in the first page and you think you need like that booking engine or if you need any other services, we can go ahead and add it on. That's not a problem. But right now. So so so I will pay, I will pay later at the end of the month, right? Yes. Yes. Right now it's just a set of fee. It's kind of just what Google kind of charges to kind of, you know, like open the account, uh verify your company with Google, strictly with Google, right? Uh um you will help us on that because we need to send like a little video to Google, right? Like maybe showing your tools and Google needs to know that you're a legit company. That's the only reason why they do that. And that might take 7 to 14 days. That's my only concern that if you come with me like let's verify your company like this ASAP, right? Cuz Yeah. within the two weeks, if they when they responded, we have to have everything ready. Website, starting to put your company name, you know, under the online directories that I that I told you about. So, once again, when we get all the verification back from Google, we got we're ready to go. We got everything to put it on Google, right? And like I said, the company name is fine, right? That's what I'm offering to you. Setting the right expectations from the beginning, right, Kendra? So, yeah. That way you can stay with me longer, okay? I want a long relationship. Okay. Were you able to see your company name? like a healthy marriage. But the healthy marriage. I don't want to work I don't want to work with nobody if we're not going to if we're not going to be married. If we're not going to have a healthy marriage. No, I'm done. I'm I don't want no off and on thing. No, I don't want to deal with a new wife. I don't want to get to know a new wife. No. No, it has to be a strictly strong relationship and healthy. Exactly. And that's the only way we're going to be successful. And Kendra, that's the only way we do business. Cuz like being like putting the cards on the table up front with you. I want a long relationship cuz the longer you stay with me, Google is going to let me like get your company more visible way longer. It means that Google works like a snowball, Kendra, you know? As far as falling down is getting bigger and bigger and bigger like a snowball effect, you know? That's how Google works, okay? And that's what I want to do for you. So like I said, let's do this, man. Uh company name is already registered, right? Yes. Yes, it is. Let me see. Okay, so is that the way you want your company to see your uh people to see that on Google? Just the way you have it there? Yes. Yeah, um well, let me I have to talk to my wife when I get home cuz she's she's the CEO. So I have to, you know, I have to confirm with her and she's the manager. She does all the um she does all the online marketing and stuff like that. So if if I can if you can call back around 2:45 um I'll let her talk to you on the phone. Okay. And you know, we'll just we'll go from there, you know? Cuz she she's she's she's the woman. She's the one. She's the single CEO. She she runs over everything, you know? And you know how you notice this cuz you move, move out because of her, right? Cuz you say you you move got you you move close to her family members, something like that? Yes, sir. That tells me a lot. Yes, sir. That tells me a lot. Okay. Is this something that you really kind of like have an interest on it or or or you're you don't saying this is just taking up the fun? You can be honest with me. No, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not I'm not cuz I have a job. I I'm I'm about to start on right now. So you know, that's why. Okay. I'm I'm busy too, you know? What do you think about the prices? I mean, is it you think the prices is is some fair? I have to talk to the wife because she'll she'll she'll know about those those information and stuff like I don't I don't deal with the the online internet. She does all that. She does all the Facebook marketing and stuff like that. We haven't even touched down to get um to to do Google yet, but um if if you can do it for us and you can just keep it if you keep us if you keep us busy enough within a month, okay, that's that's that's a win-win for us. Why not? That's a win-win for you and us. So if if we getting clientele calling us, you know, and and and we we have way enough pay you and take care of you, you know, we we don't mind, you know?

Speaker A (02:24 - 02:26): I mean, I don't want to brag.
Speaker B (02:26 - 02:29): But 60% of our customers are coming from them.
Speaker A (02:30 - 02:31): I'm not sure though if this is.
Speaker B (02:31 - 02:42): The type of service we got from them, but normally what they do is they send you leads at the same time they send it to other contractors. So you're the one chasing customers. And even if you don't get the job, you still have to pay for it.
Speaker A (02:42 - 02:43): Is that what you have for them?
Speaker B (02:44 - 02:44): Right.

Speaker B (03:45 - 03:45): Right.
Speaker A (03:45 - 03:49): Well, to be honest, I don't know them. I'm just asking because these are the.

Speaker C (04:18 - 04:19): What's that?
Speaker A (04:19 - 04:21): I mean, you don't have a website.
Speaker B (04:21 - 04:25): On your own, right? Like your own website for this business? No. Right.
Speaker A (04:26 - 04:28): Kazir, part of the package we have.
Speaker B (04:28 - 04:38): For you is creating and maintaining your website. All you have to do here is just answer the phone call providing the service, make them happy and will take care of all the liquid.
