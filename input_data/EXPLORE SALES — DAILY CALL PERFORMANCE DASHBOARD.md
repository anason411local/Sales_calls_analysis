# **4\) OBJECTION & SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

## **A) Neighborhood Leads**

### **Key Objection Themes**

| Objection Theme | Frequency | Customer Verbiage (Examples) | Recommended Rebuttal |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Cost / Budget Timing** | High | “$300 is too much right now.” / “Can I split it?” / “After holidays.” | Re-anchor ROI: “Your average job is $2,400–$3,000 — one job pays for the entire test. Let's schedule payment for the day you choose.” |
| **2\. Skepticism / Past bad agency experience** | Very High | “I paid $2,000 and got nothing.” / “Google/Yelp burned me.” / “Shared leads were terrible.” | Transparency frame: “10 exclusive leads. No contract. No retainer. No hidden fees. We prove value in 10 leads — not 3 months.” |
| **3\. Technical Issues with Link** | Medium | “Keyboard won’t load.” / “I can’t click the link.” / “Page is stuck.” | Introduce Payment Troubleshoot Script \+ offer alternate link \+ manual processing for full recovery. |
| **4\. Industry-Specific Seasonality** | Medium | “It’s winter, no one pours concrete.” / “Chimney season is ending.” | Seasonal ROI framing: “Off-season leads are fewer but higher intent — perfect for pipeline smoothing.” |
| **5\. Already Busy / No Capacity** | Medium | “I’m fully booked.” / “Short-staffed; can’t take more work.” | Pipeline reframing: “Let’s filter only high-ticket jobs so you accept fewer clients but earn more.” |
| **6\. Not Understanding Funnel / Lead Source** | Low | “Do I need a website?” / “How do customers find me?” | Simplify: “Ads → Form → Text & Email → You call. No website needed. Direct leads only.” |
| **7\. Confusion with Answer Systems Pricing** | Low | “I saw $99 earlier.” | Clarify product distinction immediately: “That’s Answer Systems. Today’s call is about Neighborhood Leads 10-for-$300.” |

### **Sentiment Summary — Neighborhood Leads**

* **Positive:** Solar, roofing, garage door installs, tree services — strong willingness to buy.

* **Neutral:** Painting, handyman, cleaning — strong curiosity but shaky budget.

* **Negative:** A handful of customers with strong distrust toward agencies or unclear financial positions.

Overall sentiment: **Product–market fit is strong**, but **trust building \+ closing discipline** is where conversion is being lost.

# **5\) INDUSTRY INSIGHTS**

## **A) Neighborhood Leads**

### **Top Performing Verticals Today**

1. **Solar (Residential & Commercial)**

   * Massive interest, especially around *battery promotions*, *tax credit urgency*, and *cost-savings narratives*.

   * Solar customers respond best to structured funnels with qualification questions.

2. **Tree Services**

   * Strong conversion patterns; ROI math resonates immediately.

   * Free estimates \+ veteran discounts remain top-performing scroll stoppers.

3. **Roofing**

   * Extremely high-ticket — ROI messaging wins.

   * Should be prioritized for Steve & Gabriel due to complexity of deal structure.

4. **Garage Door Installations**

   * High value and predictable demand.

   * Customers prefer hyper-targeted ZIP-level campaigns.

5. **Painting Services**

   * Responds well to “exclusivity” messaging, but price sensitivity is high.

6. **Small Business Funding / Insurance / Energy Brokerage**

   * Complex B2B conversations; perform best with highly specific audience filters.

   * Agents must adopt consultative, business-language frames.

### **Industry Risk Notes**

* Cleaning services: Highly saturated → heavy skepticism.

* Handyman / general home services: Hedging interest; delicate qualification required.

* Consulting / energy brokerage: Needs tailored scripts — buyers require proof of ICP alignment.

# **6\) ACTION PRIORITIES (NEXT 7 DAYS)**

## **SALES PRIORITIES**

### **Brief Summary**

* Implement **Decision Window Close** for all agents (reduces loose follow-ups).

* Standardize **Payment Troubleshoot Script** to save HOT deals from technical drop-offs.

* Enforce **ROI anchoring** early in the pitch.

* Introduce **Contingency Close** for customers with budget delays.

### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Decision Window Close**  
    Customers who request “call me later” or “Friday” must be converted into a calendar commitment.

   * Method:

     * Validate need for time.

     * Offer a precise follow-up window.

     * Secure mutual confirmation.

   * Benefits:

     * Reduces ghosting.

     * Keeps psychic momentum.

     * Significant lift in conversions for Gabriel & Eddie.

2. **Payment Troubleshoot Script**  
    Payment failures derailed at least **4 HOT deals** today.

   * Steps:

     * Reassure: “This happens sometimes — not your card.”

     * Provide alternative link.

     * Offer manual entry with secure processing.

   * Benefit:

     * Saves high-intent buyers who otherwise fall off.

3. **ROI Anchoring Early**  
    Especially in solar, roofing, and tree services.

   * Method:

     * Present the average job cost early.

     * Tie the cost of test directly to 1 project.

   * Example:  
      “One $6,000 roofing job covers your entire $300 test 20 times.”

4. **Contingency Close (Budget Delay Close)**

   * “If timing is the issue, not interest, let’s schedule your payment for Friday at 10 AM.”

   * Converts WARM → HOT consistently.

### **Examples**

* **Decision Window Close**  
   “Let’s do this — I’ll call you Friday at 10 AM. If it’s not the right time, no pressure. If it is, we finish the setup in 3 minutes.”

* **Payment Troubleshoot Script**  
   “If the keyboard isn’t loading, no problem — I’ll resend a simplified link. Happens to 1 in 10 customers.”

* **Contingency Close**  
   “If Friday is when funds clear, let’s schedule payment for 10 AM Friday so you don’t lose momentum.”

## **TRAINING PRIORITIES**

### **Brief Summary**

* Gladys: objection handling \+ frame control.

* Eddie: stronger confidence when challenged on cost.

* Gabriel: shorten pitch, prevent over-coaching.

* Steve: tighten openings and shorten value propositions.

### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Objection Handling Upgrade for Gladys**

   * Teach her response layering: Validate → Reframe → Ask.

   * Reduce pushiness when customer is firm.

   * Introduce better discovery questions to improve contextual selling.

2. **Confidence Boost Module for Eddie**

   * Eddie’s pitch is strong but defensive when questioned on pricing.

   * Train him to respond with ROI math rather than justification.

3. **Time Compression Training for Gabriel**

   * Gabriel’s long-form pitch is persuasive but time-consuming.

   * Introduce a 60-second version for busy prospects.

4. **Precision Framing for Steve**

   * Incorporate short-form hooks early.

   * Prioritize commitments over long technical explanations.

### **Examples**

* **Layered Objection Response**  
   “I hear you — a lot of owners felt that way after working with Yelp. The difference is these are exclusive — and we only test 10 at a time. What’s the biggest hesitation right now?”

* **Short Pitch (60 seconds)**  
   “We’ve been doing this 18 years. The offer is simple — 10 exclusive leads for $300. No contract. One job pays for the test. We run ads, customers fill a form, and leads go straight to your phone.”
