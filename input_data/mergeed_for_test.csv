Speaker C (01:11 - 01:26): Now, this business been established in 2020. I've been doing heating and cooling for over, like, nine years. I went to school for heating and cooling. I worked for previous companies before doing heating and cooling. Then I decided to go into my own business.
Speaker B (01:26 - 01:35): All right, well, congratulations. It's always better off being your own boss, doing your own thing, making your own money instead of just, you know, working hard, making somebody else rich, right?
Speaker C (01:36 - 01:36): Yes.
Speaker B (01:36 - 01:39): Are you the sole owner or, like, how many owners are there?

Speaker C (01:49 - 02:00): No, mainly just me. My wife. As many. Just me and my wife take care of the office stuff when she has time, or I just find a helper here or there, or I deal with somebody that I know that does work.
Speaker B (02:00 - 02:04): Okay. And you. You take on both. Residential, commercial, H Vac.
Speaker C (02:07 - 02:12): I'm only doing residential right now. Residential repairs and installation.

Speaker C (02:32 - 02:54): My trip charge, my service fee is 95. And my, let's say my little special, so like furnace maintenance and AC maintenance checks or Senfa. And with some repairs, the $95 towards the repair because I can never have a ballpark figure on certain repairs on certain equipment.
Speaker B (02:56 - 03:02): Okay. So. And how much you should be making off a lease for you to go out there and do a job, though? About 75 bucks.
Speaker C (03:02 - 03:09): 195. Just. No, 95 just to go out. Just to look at the dog, to do a diagnosis.
Speaker B (03:09 - 03:44): Okay. All right. And I really like the fact you've been doing this a long time, Ross, and this is definitely going to be a very good fencer. And he's actually a reason I my company, four Women locals, we specialize in watching traffic of search terms on the Internet. And even at this time of the year, we're actually seeing a significant increase of demand going on. Okay. If we talk about the Cleveland metro area for the past 30 days, I'm actually seeing here a total of over 8102 searches and people looking for heating and air service. That's a lot of searches, right? Over 8,000.
Speaker C (03:44 - 03:44): Yes.
Speaker B (03:45 - 04:00): What we do is we help people find you. Like, for example, somebody goes to Google with their smartphone and they type in H vac service. Even if they don't know you, they're going to see your business name, phone number popping up in first page of Google in front of them. Do you think it'd be beneficial for your business?
Speaker C (04:00 - 04:04): It's just like a Google network that deals with the Internet.
Speaker B (04:05 - 04:26): You know how it is. People nowadays when they search for something they like to buy, they typically just Google it. Right. And like what I said, we're seeing over 8,000 searches in the past 30 days in your area from people going to Google looking for H Vac. And right now, I'm in front of Google. I type in your H VAC service. I see these companies. Have you actually heard of Vern and Ellsworth Han?
Speaker C (04:26 - 04:27): No.
Speaker B (04:27 - 05:16): What about W.F. han and Son? Have you seen that around? Yes. Okay, how about Gorjank Home Services? These are your competitions, right? Yeah, yeah. They're the ones on the first page. Obviously, they're getting all those calls, Ross. And I know, you know, you do a very good job yourself. Right. You've been doing this a long time now, but there's a lot of people out there searching online. They. They don't know you yet. They're going online and they're not finding you. We can actually change that. Okay. In fact, the name of my company, just to keep you in mind of these, alright? It's 411locals. We've been in business for over 18 years now and there's only a small handful of us worldwide. It's actually a certified partner at Google. We're very, very good at what we do and what we offer you, Ross, is not just about helping people find you. Every time they see you, we make sure they'll be impressed. We're gonna help you stand out by creating your own website. Do you have a website yet?
Speaker C (05:17 - 05:22): Hold on. Before we get to the whole pitch. Is this done where I have to pay a certain amount of money a month?
Speaker B (05:22 - 05:26): Okay, well, this may sound expensive, but it's not, Ross. We've actually developed a sphere system.
Speaker C (05:27 - 05:30): Okay, well, on that part, I'm not interested.
Speaker B (05:30 - 05:33): Thank you. I mean, if you give me 100 bucks, you make a couple thousand dollars in return.

Speaker C (01:49 - 01:50): Yes.
Speaker A (01:50 - 01:56): Great. Well, speaking of leads, so how do you generate customers now or how do you normally get customers?
Speaker C (01:58 - 02:09): We deal with the paint shop on Broadway. They usually get us work. Right. People go in there and look for, buy paint and ask for people. Do they know anybody that paid? So that's how they usually get paper crate.
Speaker A (02:10 - 02:19): Right. I mean, have you ever tried going online like promoting the business to generate customers out there, like social media, Instagram, Facebook?
Speaker C (02:19 - 02:26): Yeah, well, Facebook sometimes too. Right. They get our name up, Facebook, somebody that we did jobs for that know us and stuff like that? Right?
Speaker A (02:26 - 02:27): Yeah, but have you tried doing that?
Speaker C (02:27 - 02:29): No, not really. No.
Speaker A (02:30 - 02:33): Have you ever thought of doing so like doing a business online?
Speaker C (02:34 - 02:42): Well, we're getting older now too, you know, so we're not. We're not as. Do you know what I mean? We're not like, I'm 65 years old.
Speaker A (02:42 - 02:44): Right, right, right.
Speaker C (02:46 - 03:01): We've been at this for years now. I mean, you know, we're not like, we take jobs when we want them and you know, we're not what you call flat out. But if we want to take it from work, we get from. If we don't, we don't bother. You know what I mean? The way we do it now. Right. Just take a bite here. We know me, right?
Speaker A (03:02 - 03:15): I understand that because you know the reason I asked. Our company specializes in monitoring the traffic of Christians online because users were seeing an increase in demand and the number of people going on and looking for.

Hello?
Yes, hi, good afternoon, sir.
We're looking for someone that's siding.
You guys still do repairs and installation?
Yeah, who's this?
Okay, good.
Uh, maybe you can help me.
I'm speaking with Stacy, right?
The owner?
You are.
Oh, hi, Stacy.
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Happy Monday.
Thank you very much for taking my call.
You're welcome.
Uh, yes, Stacy, uh, we're calling because we are seeing several people in the area who are looking for this type of service online.
So my manager, ma'am, asked me to look for someone who can still able to handle customers for siding.
I would like to ask if you do only residentials or are you open?
No, we don't do only residential.
Oh, okay.
So you're flexible though to any type of customer base you have for your services, right?
Correct.
Oh, that's impressive.
I'm just wondering, um, Stacy, if you don't mind me asking, ma'am, how long have you been running this business now on your own?
Well, the installer has been doing it for 20, 35 years.
Oh, dear.
30 years.
38 years.
Oh, my dear.
That's been a long time.
Congratulations for that.
Well, looking forward, sir and ma'am, for more years to come, right, for the business.
But of course.
Um, uh-huh.
For your service, you're open Monday to Friday, uh, for installation, or you're like seven days a week as well?
Uh, it depends on the weather, really.
Mhm.
Oh, okay.
It depends on, uh, the weather and how far it is or anywhere you can travel certain areas as well.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay.
That's wonderful.
Well, anyway, they say that's a businesswoman.
It was not to business as long as it pays, right, Chris?
That's what they say.
Right.
Yeah.
So anyway, um, Stacy, as what I've mentioned to you earlier, ma'am, it was my manager who actually asked me to, uh, give you a call because we're looking for, uh, reliable, um, sittings and tractors in the area.
But other than sittings, do you offer other services?
No.
Just only siding.
You don't do gutter or roof.
Correct.
No.
Nope.
Oh, okay.
I see.
Nope, I'm just a master craftsmen, master trim man.
Oh, okay.
I see.
That's good.
So, yeah, um, I'll just, uh, let you speak to my manager.
His name is Darwin, and he's on the line.
So just to be clear, um, okay.
Stacy, we are not looking for work.
We help connect customers who are already searching for your kind of service.
And my manager Darwin's on the line and he will take the call if you don't mind, okay?
Okay.
All right, thank you.
Hold on for a second.

Like, can you tell me, Of course. how long you've been in business now, ma'am? So, my husband has been doing siding since he was very young, like a teenager. He started with my dad. Very long ago. He's been doing it for 38 years. Um, companies that he works, he we subcontract sometimes. And um, he is called a master trim guy. He just um, can do all the fancy stuff. 38 years is a long time.

Okay. So, And what is the name of your business, ma'am? SMT siding. SMT like Sam, Mama, Tango? You got it. Okay. I got you. Well, let me go ahead tell you the reason I called, ma'am. And by the way, Stacy, you're one of the owners, right? Are you or does everything go through your Okay. Yes. My company, we're calling you, ma'am, because my uh we're actually uh specialize in watching traffic of search terms on internet. And we're seeing a significant amount of traffic going on even at this time of the year from people searching. And if we talk about Macomb County area for the past 30 days, Stacy, I'm actually seeing here over 2,105 searches, some people looking siding. That's a lot of searches, right? It is. Well, we can actually help them find you. Like, for example, Stacy, somebody goes online, they go to Google and they type in siding uh contractor near me, siding install, siding repair. Even if they don't know you, they're going to see your business name, phone number popping up on first page of Google in front of them. That should be very beneficial for your business, right? It could be, but word of mouth is a better way. Absolutely, ma'am. Word of mouth is always the best out there. People they they tell their friends about your good work only because they trust you, right? Correct. We're not going to take that away from you, ma'am. But what we're talking about here, Stacy, are those people out there who may haven't heard of you yet and we do see a lot of them going online looking for your service. And uh I don't think they can find you yet. In fact, I'm in front of Google right now. Stacy, I just stopped in here siding contractors. I see I see these companies. I don't know if you've heard of Siding Unlimited. Have you seen that around? No. But those kind of companies that you're running across right now, those are companies that hire us to do their work. What about those companies, I'm sorry? They subcontract it out. They hire us to do their work. They subcontract it out. Okay.
