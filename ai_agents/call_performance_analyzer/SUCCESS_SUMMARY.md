## 🎓 Transferable Wisdom Highlights

### Manuel Ramirez's Playbook

#### Technique 1: "1% Trust, 99% Work"
**When to Use**: Customer expresses skepticism or trust concerns

**What Manuel Does**:
1. Probes for underlying objection: "What is really stopping you?"
2. Quantifies ROI: "If 10 customers call, how many can you close?"
3. De-risks commitment: "Give us 1% of your trust, we'll work with the other 99%"

**How Others Can Apply**:
- Role-play probing questions
- Practice quantifying value
- Use de-risking phrases

#### Technique 2: "Proactive Postponement"
**When to Use**: Unavoidable logistical barrier (payment issue, timing)

**What Manuel Does**:
1. Acknowledges the barrier
2. Sets clear next steps: "Text me when you receive the card"
3. Re-engages on value: "Do you have questions about the services?"

**How Others Can Apply**:
- Establish concrete follow-up plans
- Log in CRM with reminders
- Always reinforce value before ending
