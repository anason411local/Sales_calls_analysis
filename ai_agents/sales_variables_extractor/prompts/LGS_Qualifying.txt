Instructions: Analyze the interaction between the Opener Agent and the Lead. Extract the following 4 specific data points. Be literal and strict with your interpretation.

Goal: Determine if the Lead confirmed they are the Owner or the Decision Maker for finance/marketing.

Categories:

Explicit Confirmation: Lead said "I am the owner," "I make the decisions," or answered "Yes" to "Are you the owner?"

Implicit/Assumed: Lead answered questions about business history or hiring, but never explicitly stated their title or authority.

Not Confirmed/Gatekeeper: Lead appears to be an employee, receptionist, or authority was never established.

Requirement: Identify the category and quote the evidence.

2. Growth Capacity Check

Goal: Did the lead confirm they want more work?

Criteria: The lead must explicitly say "Yes" to questions like "Can you handle more customers?" "Do you have capacity?" or "Are you looking for more jobs?"

Output: YES (Ready for growth) or NO (At capacity/Not interested) or UNKNOWN ( if question was not asked or customer didn't responce explicitly)

3. Industry Validation (Forbidden Check)

Goal: Identify the Lead's industry and check it against the Forbidden Industries List.

Output:

Industry Identified: (e.g., Junk Removal).

Status: PASS (Not on list) or FAIL (Is on the list).

4. Transfer Consent

Goal: Did the lead explicitly agree to speak to the Manager?

Criteria: The Agent must ask to transfer/connect the manager, and the Lead must answer with a clear affirmative (Yes, Okay, Sure, Go ahead).

Output: YES (Agreed to transfer) or NO (Did not agree/Hung up).
